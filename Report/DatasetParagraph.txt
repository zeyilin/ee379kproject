The Dataset

For our dataset, we used an repository we found on GitHub containing all of Donald Trump's tweets from 2009 to 2017. This repository is updated hourly, which was useful in having the most up-to-date data available. The data was provided in JSON format as follows:

{
    "source": "Twitter for iPhone",
    "id_str": "838899465390018560",
    "text": "I am a monster-man!",
    "created_at": "Mon Mar 06 23:49:53 +0000 2017",
    "retweet_count": 8021,
    "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null,
    "favorite_count": 33632,
    "is_retweet": false
}

For our purposes, we only needed the "text" field of the JSON, so we used Python's JSON module in order to parse the JSON files we got from the repo.

With this data, we had fairly good results. However, we noticed that a few of the tweets we  generated seemed confusing. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, given Donald Trump's general tweeting style, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather some more data in order to clean up the clarity of the tweets a bit. We thought that getting transcripts of his speeches, which (most of the time) contain full sentences, would help with constructing more understandable tweets.
We found a website [1] that contains all of his speeches from the campaign trail for the 2016 election. This website didn't have an API, so we had to scrape the site's links using Python and BeautifulSoup. This proved to be a bit tricky due to the site's formatting, which had oddly nested <p> tags for each new paragraph. Parsing it required finding the tag with class='displaytext' and removing all of the <i> italics tags. The texts also contained a lot of punctuation we didn't want to include in our model, such as ellipses, square brackets, etc. We had to remove these characters. After all of the text cleanup was done, we tokenized all of the text into sentence tokens and wrote each sentence to a file. Adding this text seemed to help with the quality of our tweets, while also making our topics somewhat less defined, probably due to the more generic context of most campaign speeches.
