14173,,1,  Wow.
14174,,1,Whoa.
14175,,1,That is some group of people.
14176,,1,Thousands.
14177,,1,"So nice, thank you very much."
14178,,1,That's really nice.
14179,,1,Thank you.
14180,,1,It's great to be at Trump Tower.
14181,,1,"It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York."
14182,,1,And it's an honor to have everybody here.
14183,,1,This is beyond anybody's expectations.
14184,,1,"There's been no crowd like this.And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in."
14185,,1,They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
14186,,1,They sweated like dogs.
14187,,1,"They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there."
14188,,1,How are they going to beat ISIS?
14189,,1,I don't think it's gonna happen.
14190,,1,Our country is in serious trouble.
14191,,1,We don't have victories anymore.
14192,,1,"We used to have victories, but we don't have them."
14193,,1,"When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?"
14194,,1,They kill us.
14195,,1,I beat China all the time.
14196,,1,All the time.
14197,,1,We want Trump.
14198,,1,We want Trump.
14199,,1,When did we beat Japan at anything?
14200,,1,"They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?"
14201,,1,When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?
14202,,1,"It doesn't exist, folks."
14203,,1,They beat us all the time.When do we beat Mexico at the border?
14204,,1,"They're laughing at us, at our stupidity."
14205,,1,And now they are beating us economically.
14206,,1,"They are not our friend, believe me."
14207,,1,But they're killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
14208,,1,Thank you.
14209,,1,"It's true, and these are the best and the finest."
14210,,1,"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best."
14211,,1,They're not sending you.
14212,,1,They're not sending you.
14213,,1,"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us."
14214,,1,They're bringing drugs.
14215,,1,They're bringing crime.
14216,,1,They're rapists.
14217,,1,"And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting."
14218,,1,And it only makes common sense.
14219,,1,It only makes common sense.
14220,,1,They're sending us not the right people.It's coming from more than Mexico.
14221,,1,"It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably   probably   from the Middle East."
14222,,1,But we don't know.
14223,,1,"Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening."
14224,,1,And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
14225,,1,Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
14226,,1,They've become rich.
14227,,1,I'm in competition with them.They just built a hotel in Syria.
14228,,1,Can you believe this?
14229,,1,They built a hotel.
14230,,1,"When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest."
14231,,1,"They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has."
14232,,1,"And in 19   and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said   and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever."
14233,,1,"But I said, ""Don't hit Iraq,"" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East."
14234,,1,"Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq."
14235,,1,Think of it.
14236,,1,"Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion."
14237,,1,"We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq."
14238,,1,"We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love   they're great   all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.And we have nothing."
14239,,1,We can't even go there.
14240,,1,We have nothing.
14241,,1,"And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees   these are big vehicles   were left behind for the enemy."
14242,,1,"2,000?"
14243,,1,"You would say maybe two, maybe four?"
14244,,1,"2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them."
14245,,1,We need Trump now.
14246,,1,You're right.
14247,,1,We need Trump now.
14248,,1,"Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product   a sign of strength, right?"
14249,,1,But not for us.
14250,,1,It was below zero.
14251,,1,Whoever heard of this?
14252,,1,It's never below zero.Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
14253,,1,"But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent."
14254,,1,Don't believe the 5.6.
14255,,1,Don't believe it.That's right.
14256,,1,A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
14257,,1,"They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs."
14258,,1,"They all have jobs.But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense."
14259,,1,We want Trump now.
14260,,1,"Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker."
14261,,1,Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
14262,,1,They don't know if it worked.
14263,,1,"And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, ""That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue."
14264,,1,They don't know what they're doing.
14265,,1,"They don't know what they're doing."""
14266,,1,We need Trump now.
14267,,1,We have a disaster called the big lie  Obamacare.
14268,,1,"Obamacare.Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof."
14269,,1,"You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless."
14270,,1,It's virtually useless.
14271,,1,It is a disaster.
14272,,1,And remember the $5 billion Web site?
14273,,1,"$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work."
14274,,1,"A $5 billion Web site.I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place."
14275,,1,"I hire people, they do a Web site."
14276,,1,It costs me $3.
14277,,1,$5 billion Web site.
14278,,1,We want Trump.
14279,,1,We want Trump.
14280,,1,We want Trump.
14281,,1,We want Trump.
14282,,1,"Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action."
14283,,1,Nothing's gonna get done.
14284,,1,They will not bring us   believe me   to the promised land.
14285,,1,"They will not.As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans."
14286,,1,And they're wonderful people.
14287,,1,I like them.
14288,,1,They all want me to support them.
14289,,1,They don't know how to bring it about.
14290,,1,They come up to my office.
14291,,1,I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
14292,,1,"And they don't know   ""Are you running?"
14293,,1,Are you not running?
14294,,1,Could we have your support?
14295,,1,What do we do?
14296,,1,How do we do it?
14297,,1,"I like them.
And I hear their speeches.
And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
They're killing us.But you don't hear that from anybody else.
You don't hear it from anybody else.
And I watch the speeches.
No more free  .
Thank you.I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
And people are saying, What's going on?"
14298,,1,I just want a job.
14299,,1,Just get me a job.
14300,,1,I don't need the rhetoric.
14301,,1,I want a job.
14302,,1,"And that's what's happening.
And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
Obama is going to be out playing golf.
He might be on one of my courses.
I would invite him, I actually would say.
I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to   I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
If he'd like to play, that's fine.
In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
Really big league.
It is going to be amazingly destructive.
Doctors are quitting.
I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it."
14303,,1,I have more accountants than I have nurses.
14304,,1,It's a disaster.
14305,,1,My patients are beside themselves.
14306,,1,They had a plan that was good.
14307,,1,They have no plan now.
14308,,1,"We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be   and   and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
Let it be for everybody.
But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
And we can do it.
Trump.
Trump.
Trump.
Trump.
Trump.
Trump.
So I've watched the politicians.
I've dealt with them all my life.
If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
You're certainly not very good.
And that's what we have representing us.
They will never make America great again.
They don't even have a chance.
They're controlled fully   they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.Yes, they control them.
Hey, I have lobbyists.
I have to tell you.
I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
They're great.
But you know what?
It won't happen.
It won't happen.
Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
It needs Trump.
Now, our country needs   our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal."""
14309,,1,Yes.
14310,,1,"We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets."
14311,,1,Our vets have been abandoned.
14312,,1,"And we also need a cheerleader.You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, ""Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well."
14313,,1,I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
14314,,1,I think he'd be a great spirit.
14315,,1,"He was vibrant.
He was young.
I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
But not a leader.
He's not a leader.
That's true.
You're right about that.But he wasn't a cheerleader.
He's actually a negative force.
He's been a negative force.
He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
It's not great again.
We need   we need somebody   we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
We can do that.
And, I will tell you, I love my life.
I have a wonderful family.
They're saying, Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
14316,,1,"You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
Just can't happen.
And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.So ladies and gentlemen   I am officially running    for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
It can happen.
Our country has tremendous potential.
We have tremendous people.We have people that aren't working.
We have people that have no incentive to work.
But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be   they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
It can happen.
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
I tell you that.
I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.Right now, think of this  We owe China $1.3 trillion.
We owe Japan more than that.
So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.How stupid are our leaders?
How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
How stupid are they?
I'm going to tell you   thank you.
I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
Our president doesn't have a clue.
He's a bad negotiator.He's the one that did Bergdahl.
We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.We get Bergdahl.
We get a traitor.
We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
That's the negotiator we have.Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
But   Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
So we need people   I'm a free trader.
But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
We have people that aren't smart.
And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
And it's just not going to work.So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything   everything, they got away with it again.
And it's impossible for our people here to compete.So I want to tell you this story.
A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
He's very upset.
I said, What's your problem?"
14317,,1,"He said, You know, I make great product."
14318,,1,"And I said, I know."
14319,,1,I know that because I buy the product.
14320,,1,"He said, I can't get it into China."
14321,,1,They won't accept it.
14322,,1,I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
14323,,1,"They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
14324,,1,"I said, Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible."
14325,,1,Does anyone know this?
14326,,1,"He said, Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
14327,,1,"I said, They send it back?""""Yeah."
14328,,1,So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.
14329,,1,They're not supposed to be doing that.
14330,,1,I told them.
14331,,1,"Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.Ask Boeing.
They wanted Boeing's secrets.
They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
I like China.
I sell apartments for   I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
Am I supposed to dislike them?
I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
Very valuable.I love China.
The biggest bank in the world is from China.
You know where their United States headquarters is located?
In this building, in Trump Tower.
I love China.
People say, Oh, you don't like China?"
14332,,1,"No, I love them.
But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
There's too much   it's like   it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.They are ripping us.
We are rebuilding China.
We're rebuilding many countries.
China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
And they're all over the place.We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.Now they're going militarily.
They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
A military island.
Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country   we would never build in an ocean.
They built it in about one year, this massive military port.They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
You have a problem with ISIS.
You have a bigger problem with China.And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
I say, That's a terrible story."
14333,,1,I hate to hear it.
14334,,1,"But I have another one, Ford.So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
Everybody thought the deal was dead.
Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
Everybody thought it was a done deal.
It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
Great state, great people.All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
Not good.Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
Ford.
Good company.So I announced that I'm running for president.
I would     one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in   and I wouldn't even use   you know, I have   I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
I know the good ones.
I know the bad ones.
I know the overrated ones.You get a lot of them that are overrated.
They're not good.
They think they are.
They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
But they're not good.But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
Believe me, folks.
We will do very, very well, very, very well.But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
If I was president, I'd say, Congratulations."
14335,,1,"I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
14336,,1,"And you say to yourself, How does that help us,"" right?"
14337,,1,"How does that help us?
Where is that good?"
14338,,1,"It's not.So I would say, ""Congratulations."
14339,,1,That's the good news.
14340,,1,Let me give you the bad news.
14341,,1,"Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.Now, here's what is going to happen."
14342,,1,"If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're  ."
14343,,1,And here's what's going to happen.
14344,,1,They're not so stupid.
14345,,1,"They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it."
14346,,1,"But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, ""You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
14347,,1,"And guess what?
No problem.
They're going to build in Mexico.
They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
It's very bad for us.So under President Trump, here's what would happen   The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
You know, they want to be a little cool.And he'll say, Please, please, please."""
14348,,1,"He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, ""No interest."""
14349,,1,"Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, ""Sorry, fellas."
14350,,1,"No interest,"" because I don't need anybody's money."
14351,,1,It's nice.
14352,,1,I don't need anybody's money.I'm using my own money.
14353,,1,I'm not using the lobbyists.
14354,,1,I'm not using donors.
14355,,1,I don't care.
14356,,1,I'm really rich.
14357,,1,"I    And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a   that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country."
14358,,1,Absolutely.
14359,,1,So   because we got to make the country rich.It sounds crass.
14360,,1,"Somebody said, ""Oh, that's crass."""
14361,,1,It's not crass.We got $18 trillion in debt.
14362,,1,We got nothing but problems.We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
14363,,1,We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.We've got nothing.
14364,,1,We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
14365,,1,All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
14366,,1,"I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it."
14367,,1,"But here's what's going to happen After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the   the donors and by the lobbyists   and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero   I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford."
14368,,1,He'll say.
14369,,1,"Please reconsider, I'll say no.He'll say, ""Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."""
14370,,1,That's it.
14371,,1,They have no choice.
14372,,1,They have no choice.There are hundreds of things like that.
14373,,1,I'll give you another example.
14374,,1,"Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day."
14375,,1,$1 billion a day.
14376,,1,I love the Saudis.
14377,,1,Many are in this building.
14378,,1,They make a billion dollars a day.
14379,,1,"Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships."
14380,,1,"We say ""we're gonna protect."""
14381,,1,What are we doing?
14382,,1,"They've got nothing but money.If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune."
14383,,1,"They wouldn't be there except for us.And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen."
14384,,1,"You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory."
14385,,1,"Two weeks later, the place was blown up."
14386,,1,Everybody got out   and they kept our equipment.They always keep our equipment.
14387,,1,"We ought to send used equipment, right?"
14388,,1,They always keep our equipment.
14389,,1,"We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be   we ought to send our surplus."
14390,,1,We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
14391,,1,Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
14392,,1,Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
14393,,1,They're gone.And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
14394,,1,"You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now   it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run."
14395,,1,I'm running.
14396,,1,"But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate."
14397,,1,"I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq."
14398,,1,He couldn't answer the question.
14399,,1,He didn't know.
14400,,1,"I said, ""Is he intelligent?"
14401,,1,"Then I looked at Rubio.
He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
He didn't know.
He couldn't answer the question.How are these people gonna lead us?
How are we gonna   how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
We can't.
They don't have a clue.
They can't lead us.
They can't.
They can't even answer simple questions.
It was terrible.But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
They were smarter than our leaders.There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
Because we need money.
We're dying.
We're dying.
We need money.
We have to do it.
And we need the right people.So Ford will come back.
They'll all come back.
And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
Yes.
Somebody said   thank you, darlin'.
Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."""
14402,,1,We don't need nice.
14403,,1,That's true.
14404,,1,But actually I am.
14405,,1,I think I am a nice person.
14406,,1,"People that know me, like me."
14407,,1,Does my family like me?
14408,,1,"I think so, right."
14409,,1,Look at my family.
14410,,1,I'm proud of my family.
14411,,1,"By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job."
14412,,1,Did she do a great job?
14413,,1,Great.
14414,,1,"Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family."
14415,,1,They're a great family.
14416,,1,"So the reporter said to me the other day, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
14417,,1,How can you get people to vote for you?
14418,,1,"I said, I don't know."""
14419,,1,"I said, ""I think that number one, I am a nice person."
14420,,1,I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
14421,,1,I think I'm actually a very nice person.
14422,,1,"But, I said, This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people."
14423,,1,And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
14424,,1,"And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education."
14425,,1,And some of them are like third world countries.
14426,,1,"But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything."
14427,,1,"So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do."
14428,,1,I'll do it.
14429,,1,"Because a lot of people said, ""He'll never run."
14430,,1,"Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."""
14431,,1,"They're right about that, but I'm doing it.Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth."
14432,,1,"And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.So I said, ""That's OK."" I'm proud of my net worth."
14433,,1,"I've done an amazing job.I started off   thank you   I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said   and I love my father."
14434,,1,I learned so much.
14435,,1,He was a great negotiator.
14436,,1,I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
14437,,1,"But I learned a lot.But he used to say, ""Donald, don't go into Manhattan."
14438,,1,That's the big leagues.
14439,,1,We don't know anything about that.
14440,,1,Don't do it.
14441,,1,"I said, I gotta go into Manhattan."
14442,,1,I gotta build those big buildings.
14443,,1,"I gotta do it, Dad."
14444,,1,I've gotta do it.
14445,,1,"And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals   the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
14446,,1,"So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
I really am.
I've employed   I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
That means medical.
That means education.
That means everything.So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
We'll be filing it right on time.
We don't need anything.
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion."""
14447,,1,"So I said (ph), ""No, that's the wrong number."
14448,,1,That's the wrong number.
14449,,1,Not assets.
14450,,1,"So they put together this.
And before I say it, I have to say this.
I made it the old-fashioned way.
It's real estate.
You know, it's real estate.It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.And I have assets   big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected   9 billion 240 million dollars.
Yeah.
And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don't have enough borrowings."
14451,,1,"Could we loan you $4 billion""?"
14452,,1,"I said, ""I don't need it."
14453,,1,I don't want it.
14454,,1,And I've been there.
14455,,1,I don't want it.
14456,,1,"But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
But here, a total net worth of   net worth, not assets, not   a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets   Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York   many other places all over the world.So the total is $8,737,540,00.Now I'm not doing that   I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
I don't have to brag.
I don't have to, believe it or not.I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
We need that thinking.
We have the opposite thinking.We have losers.
We have losers.
We have people that don't have it.
We have people that are morally corrupt.
We have people that are selling this country down the drain.So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years   you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.According to the economists   who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying   that $24 trillion   we're very close   that's the point of no return.
$24 trillion.
We will be there soon.
That's when we become Greece.
That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
And we're gonna be there very soon.
We're gonna be there very soon.
Make America strong.
So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
Yeah.
I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border.
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
Yes.
Mark my words.
Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
Nobody.
I will find   within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
Yes.
I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
I won't be doing that.
And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
That I can tell you.
I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
Now, it's very interesting.
Today I heard it.
Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump,"" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns."
14457,,1,I didn't want guns.
14458,,1,"And now since this happened""   it's up in the prison area   ""my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns."
14459,,1,We now have a gun on every table.
14460,,1,We're ready to start shooting.
14461,,1,"I said, Very interesting."
14462,,1,"So protect the Second Amendment.
End   end Common Core.
Common Core should   it is a disaster.
Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
He's weak on immigration.
He's in favor of Common Core.
How the hell can you vote for this guy?
You just can't do it.
We have to end   education has to be local.Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
Yeah.
Nobody can do that like me.
Believe me.
It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
What they do is unbelievable, how bad.You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
The Obama administration.
We got it.
It was the most highly sought after   or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
We got it.
People were shocked, Trump got it.Well, I got it for two reasons.
Number one, we're really good.
Number two, we had a really good plan.
And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
And they wanted to make sure it got built.
So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
They throw down asphalt, and they throw.You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
You have all of these disastrous airports.
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
Have to do it.
Get rid of the fraud.
Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
People have been paying it for years.
And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Yes.
Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
We have artificially low interest rates.
We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
We have a stock market that is so bloated.Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
So be very, very careful.And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
So, so important.
Yes.
Sadly, the American dream is dead.
Bring it back.
But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Good evening.
Thank you very much.
I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.
I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.
In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims.
I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state.
It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel.
Many people turned down this honor; I did not.
I took the risk and I'm glad I did.But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel.
That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me.
I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.Thank you.
My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.
Thank you.
I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.The problem here is fundamental.
We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return.
I've studied this issue in great detail.
I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.And it's a bad deal.
The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has.
The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock.
And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability.
Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is.
Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran.
First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks.
And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please.Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia.
Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have.Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.
In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.
And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation.Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world.
During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents.
They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home.
Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times.
Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.Thank you.
Do you want to hear something really shocking?
As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."""
14463,,1,You can forget that.What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew?
14464,,1,And here's another.
14465,,1,"You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part."
14466,,1,Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made.
14467,,1,"The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions."
14468,,1,"The problem is, no one has done anything about it."
14469,,1,"We will, I promise, we will.Thank you."
14470,,1,"Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations."
14471,,1,"The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel.With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody."
14472,,1,"So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine."
14473,,1,"Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal."
14474,,1,"Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate."
14475,,1,"Each side must give up something, its values."
14476,,1,"I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires."
14477,,1,"That's what a deal is.A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something."
14478,,1,That's not going to happen with the United Nations.
14479,,1,"It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel."
14480,,1,It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel.
14481,,1,"It's not going to happen, folks.And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans."
14482,,1,"Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian."
14483,,1,You don't reward behavior like that.
14484,,1,You cannot do it.
14485,,1,There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior.
14486,,1,You have to confront it.So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution.
14487,,1,It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves.
14488,,1,"They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway."
14489,,1,"The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area."
14490,,1,It's so preposterous.
14491,,1,"We're not going to let that happen.When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state."
14492,,1,"It will be vetoed 100 percent.You see, I know about deal making, that's what I do."
14493,,1,I wrote the Art of the Deal.
14494,,1,"One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying ""one of,"" because I'll be criticized if I say ""the,"" so I'm going to be very diplomatic, ""one of,"" I'll be criticized, I think it isnumber one, but why take a chance."
14495,,1,"One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.To make a great deal, you need two willing participants."
14496,,1,We know Israel is willing to deal.
14497,,1,Israel has been trying.That's right.
14498,,1,Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years.
14499,,1,"You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it."
14500,,1,"In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also.Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America."
14501,,1,They didn't even respond.
14502,,1,"When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.Thank you."
14503,,1,"And when I say something, I mean it.I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately."
14504,,1,I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.
14505,,1,"Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews."
14506,,1,"It has to stop.When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters."
14507,,1,"When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars."
14508,,1,"In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews."
14509,,1,We can't let this continue.
14510,,1,We can't let this happen any longer.You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs.
14511,,1,Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace.
14512,,1,It is a horrible way to think.
14513,,1,It's a barrier that can't be broken.
14514,,1,"That will end and it'll end soon, believe me."
14515,,1,"In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process."
14516,,1,They have to end education of hatred.
14517,,1,They have to end it and now.There is no moral equivalency.
14518,,1,Israel does not name public squares after terrorists.
14519,,1,Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians.
14520,,1,"You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way."
14521,,1,"She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America."
14522,,1,We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community.
14523,,1,"It didn't happen.President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens."
14524,,1,Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half.
14525,,1,So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States.
14526,,1,We'll get it solved one way or the other.
14527,,1,"We will get it solved.But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially."
14528,,1,"That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States.We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem."
14529,,1,"And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable."
14530,,1,They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel.
14531,,1,They must do that.And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.I love the people in this room.
14532,,1,I love Israel.
14533,,1,I love Israel.
14534,,1,"I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible."
14535,,1,My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby.
14536,,1,"In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned.So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor."
14537,,1,"Thank you, everybody."
14538,,1,Thank you.
14539,,1,Thank you very much.
14540,,1,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for the National Interest for honoring me with this invitation."
14541,,1,"I would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace."
14542,,1,It is time to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy.
14543,,1,It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold.
14544,,1,The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle.
14545,,1,"My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people, and American security, above all else."
14546,,1,That will be the foundation of every decision that I will make.
14547,,1,America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.
14548,,1,"But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back."
14549,,1,We have a lot to be proud of.
14550,,1,In the 1940s we saved the world.
14551,,1,The Greatest Generation beat back the Nazis and the Japanese Imperialists.
14552,,1,"Then we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian Communism."
14553,,1,"The Cold War lasted for decades, but we won."
14554,,1,"Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan when he said  ""tear down this wall."""
14555,,1,History will not forget what we did.
14556,,1,"Unfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course."
14557,,1,We failed to develop a new vision for a new time.
14558,,1,"In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense."
14559,,1,"Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another."
14560,,1,"We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria."
14561,,1,"Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper."
14562,,1,It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy.
14563,,1,We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed.
14564,,1,"Civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands of American lives, and many trillions of dollars, were lost as a result."
14565,,1,The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill.
14566,,1,"Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment."
14567,,1,Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster.
14568,,1,"No vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy."
14569,,1,"Today, I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy."
14570,,1,President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy.
14571,,1,"He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders."
14572,,1,Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.
14573,,1,We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.
14574,,1,Ending the theft of American jobs will give us the resources we need to rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strength.
14575,,1,I am the only person running for the Presidency who understands this problem and knows how to fix it.
14576,,1,"Our allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden."
14577,,1,But many of them are simply not doing so.
14578,,1,They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.
14579,,1,"In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense."
14580,,1,"We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia."
14581,,1,"The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and, if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves."
14582,,1,The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security.
14583,,1,A Trump Administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded.
14584,,1,We've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies.
14585,,1,"He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry."
14586,,1,"Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump Administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon."
14587,,1,All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors.
14588,,1,"In negotiation, you must be willing to walk."
14589,,1,"The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table."
14590,,1,"When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win."
14591,,1,"At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them."
14592,,1,"President Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic."
14593,,1,He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.
14594,,1,"Israel, our great friend and the one true Democracy in the Middle East, has been snubbed and criticized by an Administration that lacks moral clarity."
14595,,1,"Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel a force for justice and peace for acting as an impediment to peace in the region."
14596,,1,President Obama has not been a friend to Israel.
14597,,1,"He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power in the Middle East all at the expense of Israel, our other allies in the region and, critically, the United States."
14598,,1,"We've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help."
14599,,1,"In fact, they are just as confused as our allies, but an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously any more."
14600,,1,"When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there to meet or greet him perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One."
14601,,1,"Then, amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia -- it's called no respect."
14602,,1,"Do you remember when the President made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to get the Olympics for our country, and, after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth place?"
14603,,1,He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.
14604,,1,The list of humiliations goes on and on.
14605,,1,President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reach.
14606,,1,"Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade rules or apply the leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea."
14607,,1,He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies.
14608,,1,We've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything.
14609,,1,"If President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job."
14610,,1,"Since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy."
14611,,1,"One day we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians, the next day we are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apart."
14612,,1,We're a humanitarian nation.
14613,,1,"But the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion, and disarray."
14614,,1,We have made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.
14615,,1,We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.
14616,,1,"Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS."
14617,,1,"And we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy!"
14618,,1,"Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words ""radical Islam,"" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees."
14619,,1,"After Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans."
14620,,1,"Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep!"
14621,,1,Incredible.
14622,,1,"Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie."
14623,,1,"Our Ambassador was murdered and our Secretary of State misled the nation and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning."
14624,,1,And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil.
14625,,1,"To all our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again."
14626,,1,America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again.
14627,,1,"We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests, and the shared interests of our allies."
14628,,1,"We are getting out of the nation-building business, and instead focusing on creating stability in the world."
14629,,1,Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge.
14630,,1,"We need a new, rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, as well as by our close allies."
14631,,1,"This is how we won the Cold War, and it's how we will win our new and future struggles."
14632,,1,Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States.
14633,,1,Events may require the use of military force.
14634,,1,"But it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War."
14635,,1,"In this we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence."
14636,,1,We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam.
14637,,1,But this has to be a two-way street they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them.
14638,,1,The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland.
14639,,1,There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.
14640,,1,"For every case known to the public, there are dozens more."
14641,,1,We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.
14642,,1,A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or worse -- all you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th.
14643,,1,And then there's ISIS.
14644,,1,I have a simple message for them.
14645,,1,Their days are numbered.
14646,,1,I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how.
14647,,1,"We must as, a nation, be more unpredictable."
14648,,1,But they're going to be gone.
14649,,1,And soon.
14650,,1,"The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look what's happened to us!"
14651,,1,Our nuclear weapons arsenal our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.
14652,,1,Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.
14653,,1,The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during that time.
14654,,1,The Air Force is about 1/3 smaller than 1991.
14655,,1,Pilots are flying B-52s in combat missions today which are older than most people in this room.
14656,,1,And what are we doing about this?
14657,,1,"President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011."
14658,,1,"Our military is depleted, and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming."
14659,,1,We will spend what we need to rebuild our military.
14660,,1,It is the cheapest investment we can make.
14661,,1,"We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind."
14662,,1,Our military dominance must be unquestioned.
14663,,1,But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely.
14664,,1,"In this time of mounting debt, not one dollar can be wasted."
14665,,1,"We are also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again and to put Americans first again."
14666,,1,"This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might as a nation."
14667,,1,We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives us an edge.
14668,,1,"This includes 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare."
14669,,1,A great country also takes care of its warriors.
14670,,1,Our commitment to them is absolute.
14671,,1,"A Trump Administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve, and the best care in the world when they return as veterans to civilian life."
14672,,1,Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.
14673,,1,Look at what happened in the 1990s.
14674,,1,Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.
14675,,1,And what did we do?
14676,,1,It seemed we put more effort into adding China to the World Trade Organization which has been a disaster for the United States than into stopping Al Qaeda.
14677,,1,"We even had an opportunity to take out Osama Bin Laden, and didn't do it."
14678,,1,"And then, we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the worst attack on our country in its history."
14679,,1,"Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests, and the following will be my priorities."
14680,,1,"In the Middle East, our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change."
14681,,1,We need to be clear-sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.
14682,,1,And we must only be generous to those that prove they are our friends.
14683,,1,We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China.
14684,,1,"We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes."
14685,,1,But we are not bound to be adversaries.
14686,,1,We should seek common ground based on shared interests.
14687,,1,"Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism."
14688,,1,I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength is possible.
14689,,1,Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end.
14690,,1,Some say the Russians won't be reasonable.
14691,,1,I intend to find out.
14692,,1,"If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table."
14693,,1,Fixing our relations with China is another important step towards a prosperous century.
14694,,1,"China respects strength, and by letting them take advantage of us economically, we have lost all of their respect."
14695,,1,"We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit we must find a way, quickly, to balance."
14696,,1,A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China.
14697,,1,We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.
14698,,1,"After I am elected President, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies, and a separate summit with our Asian allies."
14699,,1,"In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges."
14700,,1,"For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism."
14701,,1,I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative.
14702,,1,"But if America fights, it must fight to win."
14703,,1,I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary and will only do so if we have a plan for victory.
14704,,1,"Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction."
14705,,1,"The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy."
14706,,1,"With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite  a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake."
14707,,1,"After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worse shape now in the Middle East than ever before."
14708,,1,I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton it has been a complete and total disaster.
14709,,1,I will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources.
14710,,1,Financial leverage and sanctions can be very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with determination.
14711,,1,Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.
14712,,1,"Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it."
14713,,1,"However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct."
14714,,1,You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy.
14715,,1,A superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength.
14716,,1,"Although not in government service, I was totally against the War in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East."
14717,,1,"Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary was Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their rich oil reserves something it has wanted to do for decades."
14718,,1,"And now, to top it all off, we have ISIS."
14719,,1,My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations.
14720,,1,"That is why I will also look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war."
14721,,1,"Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions."
14722,,1,"Instead of trying to spread ""universal values"" that not everyone shares, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions."
14723,,1,"I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, and which our friends and allies will respect and welcome."
14724,,1,"The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies."
14725,,1,"To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again."
14726,,1,Many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than their own.
14727,,1,Americans must know that we are putting the American people first again.
14728,,1,"On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy the jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority."
14729,,1,No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.
14730,,1,"Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same."
14731,,1,"We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism."
14732,,1,The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.
14733,,1,"I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down, and will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs."
14734,,1,"NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the U.S. and has emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs."
14735,,1,Never again.
14736,,1,Only the reverse will happen.
14737,,1,We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones.

14750,,1,Thank you.
14751,,1,Thank you for joining me today.
14752,,1,"This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.But today there is only one thing to discuss  the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.The horror is beyond description.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated."
14753,,1,"Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.We mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack."
14754,,1,"[SILENCE]Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.This is a very dark moment in America's history.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people with force, purpose and determination.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart and fast we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States."
14755,,1,"His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views."
14756,,1,"The father even said he was running for President of that country.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on."
14757,,1,"The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.I will use this power to protect the American people."
14758,,1,"When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.It's not just a national security issue."
14759,,1,"It is a quality of life issue.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.The male shooter in San Bernardino again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year."
14760,,1,"According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.Yet, Hillary Clinton for months and despite so many attacks repeatedly refused to even say the words ""radical Islam,"" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.However, Hillary Clinton who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam."
14761,,1,"Here is what she said  ""Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
14762,,1,"Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.
They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.
Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.In fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss it's deadly.The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement.
They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.I refuse to be politically correct.I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none.
That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials and with our allies.I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism and who will have the support they require to get the job done.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.These Departments refused to comply.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.The public has a right to know how these people got here.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando.
Can you imagine large groups?Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing.
He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.
Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.We can't let this happen.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it.
Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.What I want is common sense.
I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.That is the choice I put before the American people  a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words?
Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women, and murder gays.I don't want them in our country.The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice.If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .America must do more much more to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.It also means we must change our foreign policy.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.
That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism.
Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.We've tried it President Obama's way.
He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.
Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.America will be a tolerant and open society.America will also be a safe society.We will protect our borders at home.We will defeat ISIS overseas.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.We will make America rich again.We will make America safe again.We will make American Great Again.Thank you.The media talks about homegrown,"" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past."
14763,,1,"But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth."
14764,,1,"Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.She can't have it both ways."
14765,,1,She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.How does this kind of immigration make our life better?
14766,,1,"How does this kind of immigration make our country better?Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here in vast numbers who reject our values?Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities.America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.So whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this."
14767,,1,"We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief."
14768,,1,"This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities."
14769,,1,"But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they do know where they are.I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market."
14770,,1,I want every American to succeed.
14771,,1,Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.I want to protect our citizens all of our citizens.
14772,,1,Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.
14773,,1,"People have asked me why I am running for President.I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.We come to work together and turn visions into reality.We think big, and then we make it happen.I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer  I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton only by me.The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be."
14774,,1,But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement  so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.
14775,,1,"Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.Because it's not just the political system that's rigged."
14776,,1,"It's the whole economy.It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.It's rigged against you, the American people.Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses."
14777,,1,"But here is the bottom line  I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars."
14778,,1,"I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs."
14779,,1,"That is a talent our country desperately needs.I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.Here is my promise to the American voter If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests and taking money from special interests.Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests in less than 2 years secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public."
14780,,1,"Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.They totally own her, and that will never change.The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.Those are the stakes.Hillary Clinton wants to be President."
14781,,1,"But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.She believes she is entitled to the office.Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her."
14782,,1,"You know what my response to that is?
I'm with you  the American people.She thinks it's all about her.I know it's all about you I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism focusing on what's good for America's middle class to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.That's what we mean by America First.Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.Our Founders understood this.One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]"" in America.Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying ""The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."
14783,,1,"I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property a crime which is continuing to this day.Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.She gets rich making you poor.Here is a quote from the book  At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."
14784,,1,"These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.
She has even deleted this record of total support from her book deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.
)But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything  if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.
She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars and unleashed ISIS across the world.No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.
He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say I want the whole world to know it  she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president."
14785,,1,"In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.Libya was cooperating.Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Syria was under control.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.ISIS wasn't even on the map.Fast forward to 2013  In just four years, Secretary Clinton managedto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.
The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit."
14786,,1,"Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.
Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.
So what did this company do?
For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.
The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access even though he had no national security credentials.Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State plus millions more for her foundation.
The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.
The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.
Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China putting all of America in danger.Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.National security is also immigration security and Hillary wants neither.Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.
They are the ones she will hurt the most.Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country."
14787,,1,"Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her."
14788,,1,She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.
14789,,1,"Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.
She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.
Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobsStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are manyCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseasLift restrictions on energy productionRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.There is one common theme in all of these reforms.It's going to be America First.This is why the stakes in November are so great.On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.The voters are the jury.
Their ballots are the verdict.
We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired.
Her message is that can't change.My message is that things have to change and this is our one chance do it.
This is our last chance to do it.Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.Then we started thinking small.We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.But that's not who we are.Come this November, we can bring America back bigger and better, and stronger than ever.We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment we will bring it back all the way.Massive new factories will come roaring into our country breathing life and hope into our communities.Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.
Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.Our country is going to start working again.People are going to start working again.Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again including parents in our inner cities.Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.We are going to make America rich again.We are going to make America safe again.We are going to make America Great Again and Great Again For EVERYONE.
Thank you.
I'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans.Before going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform  the men and women in blue.Our Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism.They save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report.But I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you.The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country.Our whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time.Yet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty.America's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos and the destruction of our country as we know it.We must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest.
Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.It is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end and to end right now.We went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas.
For too many police today, that is their daily reality.At the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected.
We were all disturbed by the images we saw.We must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities.
According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone.
This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.Violent crime has increased in cities across America.
The New York Times described a startling rise in murders,"" in our major cities.Brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.Too many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.Our inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.I am the law and order candidate.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.Personally, I think she is both.Not only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion."
14790,,1,But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States.
14791,,1,"Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.Everyone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.We will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair and we will protect all Americans.Without safety, we have nothing!It is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again   For Everyone.That promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.The men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.Now is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.We made a promise to these heroes."
14792,,1,"You defend America, and America will defend you.But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.President Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that ""it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be."
14793,,1,"She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run that's because she has been part of the rigged system.Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives instead of spending time with real people in real pain.The disconnect in America is deep.There are two Americas  the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.An internal memo from a senior VA official describes lawlessness and chaos,"" at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.The memo also says they ""waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws"" and warns that ""these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans."
14794,,1,"Even the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described significant and chronic systemic failures,"" in Veterans Affairs, including ""a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department,"" with ""poor management,"" and ""a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues."""
14795,,1,"He said there is a ""lack of accountability across all grade levels."
14796,,1,"Here are just a few examples --Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.--The St.
Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.Can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?Most of those responsible have still not been held to account.Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities and it will happen.
It will be fixed.Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.We must extend this right to all Veterans– not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.This promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.Every year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.Veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.This is a national tragedy.The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large.
This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need especially in emergencies.Right now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.That's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.In fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.In 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.Two other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.It doesn't have to be this way.As Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said  The VA is not sacred."
14797,,1,The Veteran is.
14798,,1,"I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans.
Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.
I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.I will create a private White House Hotline that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.That's a promise.We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.
We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.
We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.Never again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.She is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.Crooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.Our country needs change, and she will never give us change.The fact is, she helped create our rigged system.Hillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material which is still totally disqualifying.
This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.In fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.Afterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.When thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget  many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions.
These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.If elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.Just look at what the FBI Director said about her her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law.
Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.The decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.The years of American Greatness will return.We are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.We are going to make American Great Again And Safe Again For All Americans.We will dream big and bold and daring things once more.Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.We will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Great honor.
Great honor, thank you.
This is a wonderful day.
Aww.
[ ] Wow.
On a Saturday morning yet.
Isn't that nice?
Thank you, all.
And we're going to have an incredible convention.
It's really going well.
We're going to have an incredible convention.
And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.
So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again.
I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France.
We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look.
And now it's happening more and more.
And it's never going to stop.
We need new leadership.
We need new thinking.
We need strength.
We need in our country law and order.
And if I'm elected president, that will happen.
I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.
And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people.
We wish them well.
It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well.
A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.
Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years.
The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before.
Never been like this.
Out of control.
After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Iraq, Syria, all into chaos.
And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons.
And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end.
Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton.
You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.
We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs.
They've been taken away, like we're babies.
Taken away.
And we're going to bring them back.
I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans.
Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice.
I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana.
And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.
But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you.
He is a solid, solid person.
Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress.
He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference.
Number one.
He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration.
It's horrible out there.
High taxes and regulations.
And it's out of control.
Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty.
We know that.
Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption.
She's a corrupt person.
What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads.
She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent.
She's crooked Hillary.
And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime.
Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.
Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK?
Didn't give them to the FBI?
Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK?
Wipes her server clean, that's OK?
These are crimes.
These are crimes.
And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.
But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around.
She's going to pay it at the polls.
I believe that.
On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time.
She's totally owned by Wall Street.
We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism.
And it's not that she believes in it.
The people that give her all of this money believe in it.
And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe.
Believe me.
That's it.
What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.
Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy  Radical Islam.
Radical Islamic terrorism.
You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window.
You heard what he was screaming out the window.
You saw it in San Bernardino.
You saw it at the World Trade Center.
You saw it in Orlando.
How horrible was that?
You saw it in Paris.
You see it all over.
And Hillary is a weak person.
We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party.
We're going to change things around.
There's going to be respect again for law and order.
Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS.
You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on.
If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests.
Got a lot of money.
But I see the ads on foreign policy.
She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience.
Of course not.
I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson.
I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq.
Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson.
I was a civilian.
Take the oil.
Many, many calls I've made.
You take a look.
I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen.
I was the one that predicted it.
And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong.
President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win.
I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do.
And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.
And I said that Brexit's going to happen.
I said that they are going to break away.
And everybody laughed at me.
And the odds were 20 percent.
And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen.
And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right.
I appreciate that.
Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.
So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy.
So important.
Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest.
So many people have said party unity.
Because I'm an outsider.
I want to be an outsider.
I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides.
I won in landslides.
This wasn't close.
This wasn't close.
No, this wasn't close.
This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three.
There were 17.
We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes.
That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.
Think of it.
That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love.
That's more than Richard Nixon.
It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower.
You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness.
Pretty good.
It's more than the Bushes.
But I mean by a lot.
I don't mean by a little.
But that's with 17 people.
People don't over-say that.
That means our message is unbelievable.
And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.
But they displayed it.
It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK?
Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump.
Oh, we're going to win.
They got crushed.
And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.
They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers.
We're going to put 'em back to work.
So they're very tired of it.
But I want to thank all of those people that delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something.
Did we show them something.
And unfortunately, the vote was very late.
But essentially, we had 112-12.
This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight.
We're not going to have a fight.
People agree with what we've -- they want the wall.
They want the borders.
They want these things to happen.
And what we're doing    And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it.
We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination.
The evangelicals have been unbelievable.
I dominated with the evangelicals.
A lot of people were surprised.
They say he's not perfect.
But you know what?
They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart.
And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do.
You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group.
And he was a powerful president.
He knew how to get things done.
He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him.
But he was a powerful president.
And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status.
We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment.
And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.
I saw this.
I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?
And they didn't know how to answer the question.
And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out.
One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues.
We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.
And I looked out the window.
I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street.
I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't.
That means they're more powerful than you are.
We have to do something about it.
How did it start?
How did it start?
And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson.
And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader.
And he did this, and he got it done.
And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away.
And we're going to change that.
OK?
All right.
Back to Mike Pence.
So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big.
Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall.
That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places.
But Indiana was going to be the firewall.
So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before.
NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton.
NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country.
Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent.
It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.
I have a friend who's a great builder.
What he builds is plants.
That's all he does, is build plants.
He doesn't build buildings.
He doesn't -- he builds plants.
It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.
I said, how's business?
I was with him the other day.
How's business?
He goes unbelievable.
I said, really, wow, I'm surprised.
Why is it unbelievable?
Because I think of him as building in this country.
He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe.
I said, what do you mean?
He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.
I said, what about this country?
Not much.
Not much.
That's the expression.
He said exactly that.
Not much.
I said, but Mexico?
He said, you've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
Folks, that's going to stop.
We're going to go reverse it.
We're going to bring our jobs back to this country.
We can't be the stupid people anymore.
OK?
And he was better than a pollster.
He's better than a consultant.
I would say, how are we doing?
And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars.
Doesn't cost me millions.
Me, I give them $10,000, OK?
It costs other people millions.
It costs other campaigns millions to get a report.
Every time they get a report, it's millions.
But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report.
And he said it.
He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it.
Just fact.
How are we doing?
Unbelievable in Mexico.
In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.
And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan.
We want them to build them in Michigan.
They're going to build them in Michigan.
And you know that I know how to do that.
So easy.
So easy.
But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution.
There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here.
There are consequences.
And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country.
It's very simple.
And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike.
Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing.
Incredible family.
Highly respected.
Expected to go for another four years.
He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana.
Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen.
When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016.
Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs.
You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states.
I've gone to all of them.
And every time, I have statisticians.
I say give me the stats on a state.
And it's always bad, down, down, down.
Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases.
Here's somebody where it's gone up.
Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013.
That's like very unusual.
Governor Pence balanced the budget.
Can you imagine a balanced budget?
Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing.
We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion.
He balanced the budget.
They don't know what that means.
Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.
It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A.
Very few states have that.
Triple-A.
The best.
That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A.
Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business.
Number one.
And it's not even close.
There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office.
So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.
And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me.
I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight.
But he agrees with everything I'm saying.
He loves the governor.
Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.
If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A.
is much better.
They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for.
People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors.
People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor.
It's a scandal.
Take a look at what's happening with the V.A.
in Arizona.
Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals.
It's a scandal.
It's corrupt.
It's incompetent.
It's a scandal.
And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine.
And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans.
I mean, we know that for a fact.
So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans.
In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent.
It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best.
Got 'em jobs.
Got 'em jobs.
Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates.
That's a great thing.
They're going to stay there.
That's a great thing.
And Mike worked hard on that.
He was telling me, that was not easy.
Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history.
So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education.
Isn't that a great thing?
Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America.
School choice is where it's at, folks.
You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast.
Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history.
Think of that.
We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets.
And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country.
CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.
So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up.
That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump.
I build infrastructure.
Do I know how to build a wall?
Do I know how to build infrastructure?
You know, it's very interesting.
We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services.
And I really like what's happened.
We're going to have an opening very soon.
Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.
But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially.
And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.
And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before.
They've never heard them.
So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country.
The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there.
And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide.
And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember.
He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump.
I said, who did he endorse?
So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK?
I will tell you.
So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans  I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.
We will be a country of generosity and warmth.
But we will also be a country of law and order.Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.
The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.
Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.
Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.I have a message for all of you  the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon and I mean very soon come to an end.Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
Go there.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.
We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities.
That's the largest increase in 25 years.
In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.
They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone.
And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.
Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.
They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.
She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.
Number one in her class.
Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.I've met Sarah's beautiful family.
But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting.
No more.
One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.
What about our economy?Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper  Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed.
2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.
Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone.
We're going to fix that.The budget is no better.President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.
And yet, what do we have to show for it?
Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.
One after another.
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.
Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.In Libya, our consulate the symbol of American prestige around the globe was brought down in flames.
America is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.Let's defeat her in November, OK.I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets.
Her bad instincts and her bad judgment something pointed out by Bernie Sanders are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.
Let's review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable.
Egypt was peaceful.
Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence.
Iran was being choked by sanctions.
Syria was somewhat under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?
ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.
Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.
Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.
Iraq is in chaos.
Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.
Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West.
After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton  death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
The problems we face now poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.
A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.
Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.
The American People will come first once again.
My plan will begin with safety at home which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.
There can be no prosperity without law and order.
On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.
That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.
Believe me, it's for their benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.
They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does.
She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change never ever.
My message is that things have to change and they have to change right now.
Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.
These are the forgotten men and women of our country.
And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long.
People who work hard but no longer have a voice.I am your voice!I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
[disruption in the audience] How great are our police?
And how great is Cleveland?I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did."
14799,,1,"They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly."
14800,,1,"When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves."
14801,,1,"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it."
14802,,1,"I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders he never had a chance.But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue  trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country."
14803,,1,Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American.
14804,,1,"In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States  Governor Mike Pence of Indiana."
14805,,1,"And a great guy.We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing."
14806,,1,He is a man of character and accomplishment.
14807,,1,He is the man for the job.
14808,,1,The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.
14809,,1,"In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials."
14810,,1,"Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."
14811,,1,"Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured."
14812,,1,An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
14813,,1,"I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police  when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country."
14814,,1,"Believe me, believe me."
14815,,1,"I will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done."
14816,,1,"In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.This Administration has failed America's inner cities."
14817,,1,Remember  it has failed America's inner cities.
14818,,1,It's failed them on education.
14819,,1,It's failed them on jobs.
14820,,1,It's failed them on crime.
14821,,1,"It's failed them at every level.When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.Every action I take, I will ask myself  does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?"
14822,,1,"Any other child.To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country  We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism."
14823,,1,"Men, women and children viciously mowed down."
14824,,1,Lives ruined.
14825,,1,Families ripped apart.
14826,,1,"A nation in mourning.The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee."
14827,,1,"And many, many other locations.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist."
14828,,1,"This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community no good and we're going to stop it.As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology beleive me.And as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said."
14829,,1,"Thank you.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world."
14830,,1,"We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria."
14831,,1,"Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly."
14832,,1,We're going to win.
14833,,1,"We're going to win fast.This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel."
14834,,1,"Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share."
14835,,1,"As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost."
14836,,1,"Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place."
14837,,1,We don't want them in our country.My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this.
14838,,1,Think of this.
14839,,1,"This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama."
14840,,1,She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.
14841,,1,I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.
14842,,1,"Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers."
14843,,1,"We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw."
14844,,1,They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely.
14845,,1,"Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve."
14846,,1,We have to solve it.These families have no special interests to represent them.
14847,,1,There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.
14848,,1,"My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me."
14849,,1,"Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities."
14850,,1,But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
14851,,1,"Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel?"
14852,,1,"Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?These wounded American families have been alone."
14853,,1,But they are alone no longer.
14854,,1,"Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities."
14855,,1,"I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system."
14856,,1,"Lawful.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence."
14857,,1,Illegal border crossings will go down.
14858,,1,We will stop it.
14859,,1,It won't be happening very much anymore.
14860,,1,Believe me.
14861,,1,Peace will be restored.
14862,,1,"By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced."
14863,,1,We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
14864,,1,U.S.A.!
14865,,1,U.S.A.!
14866,,1,U.S.A.!My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.
14867,,1,Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.
14868,,1,"Communities want relief.Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness."
14869,,1,"Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers."
14870,,1,"It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many."
14871,,1,"It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.I have made billions of dollars in business making deals now I'm going to make our country rich again."
14872,,1,"Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements."
14873,,1,"America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.Never, ever again.I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences."
14874,,1,"Not going to happen anymore.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class."
14875,,1,"She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea."
14876,,1,She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
14877,,1,"The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments."
14878,,1,And it's not going to happen.
14879,,1,"I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence."
14880,,1,"I will never, ever sign bad trade deals."
14881,,1,"America fist, again!"
14882,,1,America first!
14883,,1,"Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands."
14884,,1,"We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation."
14885,,1,They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever!
14886,,1,"Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated."
14887,,1,That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.
14888,,1,"We are going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules."
14889,,1,"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year Democrat or Republican."
14890,,1,"Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world."
14891,,1,Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.
14892,,1,"Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast."
14893,,1,"Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all."
14894,,1,"Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly."
14895,,1,We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
14896,,1,"This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business that will never happen with Donald Trump as President."
14897,,1,Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.
14898,,1,"With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow."
14899,,1,"This, in turn, will create millions more jobs."
14900,,1,We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.
14901,,1,"And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done."
14902,,1,We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
14903,,1,You will be able to choose your own doctor again.
14904,,1,And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!
14905,,1,Thank you.
14906,,1,"Thank you.We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before."
14907,,1,My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support.
14908,,1,We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread one more sign of how out of touch she really is.
14909,,1,We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
14910,,1,"The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies."
14911,,1,Very important.
14912,,1,This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
14913,,1,My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.
14914,,1,"I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight."
14915,,1,So true.
14916,,1,"They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits."
14917,,1,"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."
14918,,1,Their voice has been taken away.I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.
14919,,1,"We can accomplish these great things, and so much else all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again."
14920,,1,Start believing.
14921,,1,"It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron  you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy."
14922,,1,"And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job?"
14923,,1,"My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew."
14924,,1,"I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people."
14925,,1,"He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also."
14926,,1,"I love those people.Then there's my mother, Mary."
14927,,1,"She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded."
14928,,1,She was a truly great mother.
14929,,1,"She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character."
14930,,1,"She could pick 'em out from anywhere.To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me."
14931,,1,"I have loved my life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country to go to work for all of you."
14932,,1,It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.
14933,,1,"We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again."
14934,,1,"But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.Remember  All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."
14935,,1,Not a chance!
14936,,1,The same people.
14937,,1,"Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we?"
14938,,1,"Love it, love it, love it."
14939,,1,"No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place."
14940,,1,"Instead, we must choose to Believe In America."
14941,,1,"History is watching us now.It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong."
14942,,1,I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge.
14943,,1,"It reads  ""I'm With Her""."
14944,,1,"I choose to recite a different pledge.My pledge reads  ""I'M WITH YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."
14945,,1,"I am your voice.So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight  I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.God bless you, and good night!
I love you!
.
So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference.
And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why.
And I'll tell you why.
Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.
You look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned.
You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police.
They mention everybody but our police.
They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw.So you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun.
235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton.
You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on.Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it.
Bernie Sanders never had a chance.And total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast.
The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious.
What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible.If I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race.With her, everything's just fine.
So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences.
And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad.When they talk about change, I noticed they have change.
She's been there for 30 years.
Thirty years.
There's no change.
It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama.
In my opinion, worse.She lied about TPP.
She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States.And I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated.
And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements.
First time, yesterday.
Well, because of me.She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation.
And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate.So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it.
And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it.They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't.
They will vote it in just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it but she will vote.She'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side.
Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period.We don't even read it, our country.
Because we're led by stupid people.
so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests.They're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it.
The day she gets in which hopefully will never happen she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP.
And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK?So why don't we start off any questions?
Yes, sir?.
.
It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia.
In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook.
I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking.By the way, they hacked they probably have her 33,000 e-mails.
I hope they do.
They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there.
So let's see.But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked.
Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it.
I think he was live.
But he said we think it was Russia that hacked.And then he said and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah.
Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump.
He reminded me of John Lovitz for Saturday Night Live"" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes."
14946,,1,"This is the guy, you have to see it."
14947,,1,"Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes."
14948,,1,So it is so farfetched.
14949,,1,It's so ridiculous.
14950,,1,Honestly I wish I had that power.
14951,,1,"I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.And that's why if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed."
14952,,1,"But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are."
14953,,1,"Total assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country."
14954,,1,Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader.
14955,,1,So I know nothing about it.
14956,,1,It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard.
14957,,1,"Yes, Jon?."
14958,,1,.
14959,,1,"I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is."
14960,,1,He said one nice thing about me.
14961,,1,He said I'm a genius.
14962,,1,I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it.
14963,,1,I never met Putin..  .
14964,,1,I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries.
14965,,1,"Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia?"
14966,,1,"I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.You saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse."
14967,,1,"And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country."
14968,,1,We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands.
14969,,1,You see what happened to the French priest.
14970,,1,"A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago."
14971,,1,I saw him yesterday.
14972,,1,I said how'd you like France.
14973,,1,He said I wouldn't go to France.
14974,,1,I wouldn't go to France.
14975,,1,Because France is no longer France.
14976,,1,France is no longer France.
14977,,1,"They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man."
14978,,1,"France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.And by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years."
14979,,1,She's been doing this for 30 years.
14980,,1,What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change?
14981,,1,She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists.
14982,,1,"Yes, Tom?."
14983,,1,.
14984,,1,"None, none..  ."
14985,,1,Because it's under order.
14986,,1,And I'll release them when the audits completed.
14987,,1,Nobody would release when it's under I've had audits for 15 or 16 years.
14988,,1,Every year I have a routine audit.
14989,,1,"I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them."
14990,,1,"But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?."
14991,,1,.
14992,,1,"I don't know, I don't know."
14993,,1,It depends on the audit.
14994,,1,"It depends on the audit, not a big deal."
14995,,1,"By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents."
14996,,1,"I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world."
14997,,1,You've seen it.
14998,,1,"You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought."
14999,,1,I have a great company.
15000,,1,"I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer."
15001,,1,She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit.
15002,,1,It's a routine audit.
15003,,1,"I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years."
15004,,1,I have friends that are very rich and never get audited.
15005,,1,I'm audited every year.
15006,,1,"Maybe that's because of politics, who knows..  ."
15007,,1,I'm not going to tell Putin what to do.
15008,,1,Why should I tell Putin what to do?
15009,,1,"He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence."
15010,,1,"Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking."
15011,,1,It was about the things that were said in those e-mails.
15012,,1,"They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it."
15013,,1,She knew everything.Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton.
15014,,1,Couldn't breathe.
15015,,1,And you saw that.
15016,,1,"It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails."
15017,,1,It was a rigged race.
15018,,1,It was totally rigged.
15019,,1,"And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy."
15020,,1,He wants to go home and go to sleep.
15021,,1,But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night.
15022,,1,"Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night."
15023,,1,I didn't even hear about it.
15024,,1,Nobody showed it.
15025,,1,I didn't see it on television.
15026,,1,You people don't talk about it.The Republican Convention was incredible.
15027,,1,I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades.
15028,,1,"Like, some people are saying nine points."
15029,,1,"In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, ""Los Angeles Times"", Trump 47, Clinton 40."
15030,,1,And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton..   Putin say stay out?
15031,,1,Why not say that?.
15032,,1,Why do I have to get involved with Putin?
15033,,1,I have nothing to do with Putin.
15034,,1,I've never spoken to him.
15035,,1,I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
15036,,1,He doesn't respect our president.
15037,,1,"And if it is Russia which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything."
15038,,1,"But it would be interesting to see I will tell you this Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing."
15039,,1,I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
15040,,1,Let's see if that happens.
15041,,1,That'll be next.
15042,,1,"Yes, sir ."
15043,,1,this audience and make our campaign what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country  ?OK.
15044,,1,Sure.
15045,,1,Two big questions.
15046,,1,The minimum wage has to go up.
15047,,1,"People are at least $10, but it has to go up."
15048,,1,But I think that states federal I think that states should really call the shot.
15049,,1,"As an example, I live in New York."
15050,,1,It's very expensive in New York.
15051,,1,You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about.
15052,,1,You go to other states and it's not expensive at all.
15053,,1,"Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen."
15054,,1,"At the same time, people have to be taken care of."
15055,,1,"But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage but it has to go up.Now, Bernie Sanders lied."
15056,,1,Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7.
15057,,1,"I said, where did he come up with that one?"
15058,,1,That one is just like Joe Biden lied today.
15059,,1,"He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb he was on television he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East."
15060,,1,"Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that."
15061,,1,That was not Donald Trump.
15062,,1,"I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it."
15063,,1,And he said it with such surety Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb I never said I wanted to carpet bomb.
15064,,1,That was Ted Cruz.
15065,,1,You remember Ted Cruz said it?
15066,,1,"You will confirm that, I think."
15067,,1,"Go ahead.So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming."
15068,,1,I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day great guy.
15069,,1,"He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything."
15070,,1,That's what he does.
15071,,1,"I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.And I said, how's it going?"
15072,,1,"He said, unbelievable."
15073,,1,"Oh good, that's good news."
15074,,1,The country's doing well.
15075,,1,"No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable."
15076,,1,"The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything it's the eighth wonder of the world."
15077,,1,And he's not happy.
15078,,1,He's an American guy.
15079,,1,He'd rather build them here.
15080,,1,But he said it's unbelievable.
15081,,1,That's what's happened to our country.
15082,,1,Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing..   special extreme vetting?.
15083,,1,Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories.
15084,,1,And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting.
15085,,1,And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway.
15086,,1,Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions.
15087,,1,"And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening.You look at Orlando, how bad was that?"
15088,,1,And that was horrible.
15089,,1,That was going after the gay community it looks like.
15090,,1,We can't let this happen.
15091,,1,We cannot let this happen.
15092,,1,We cannot let people come in.Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it.
15093,,1,"Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey."
15094,,1,First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey.
15095,,1,And he still isn't.
15096,,1,What?I mean Virginia.
15097,,1,"The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase."
15098,,1,And he's not very popular.
15099,,1,"So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day."
15100,,1,And I thought he'd be popular.
15101,,1,He's not popular because he asked for tax increases.
15102,,1,Big tax increases in Virginia.
15103,,1,Big.
15104,,1,"And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure.But what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants."
15105,,1,And it's unacceptable.
15106,,1,OK.
15107,,1,Yes?
15108,,1,.
15109,,1,Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges .
15110,,1,I saw that.. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case..
15111,,1,Right..
15112,,1,Your reaction  ?.
15113,,1,"I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do."
15114,,1,I think she ought to prosecute herself OK?
15115,,1,That's my reaction.
15116,,1,I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it.
15117,,1,And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts.And I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal.
15118,,1,"I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out."
15119,,1,And you had victory after victory after victory.
15120,,1,"And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first."
15121,,1,She should prosecute herself.
15122,,1,She should be held accountable..   to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case.
15123,,1,"Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre.. Well, that was a bad case to prove it."
15124,,1,That was a bad case.
15125,,1,"I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly."
15126,,1,But you have to get the right time.
15127,,1,This was not one of those times.
15128,,1,And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did.
15129,,1,Yes ma'am?.
15130,,1,So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him .
15131,,1,Yeah.. And   .
15132,,1,I have a great relationship with Governor Pence.
15133,,1,We spent the last three days together.
15134,,1,He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press.
15135,,1,"The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11 05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept."
15136,,1,And he accepted.
15137,,1,And that was it.
15138,,1,For me that was it.But right around that time you had the attack in Nice.
15139,,1,And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day.
15140,,1,"And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible."
15141,,1,In France.
15142,,1,"And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts."
15143,,1,I never had a second thought in my life.
15144,,1,It was such a lie.
15145,,1,I mean so many lies in the press.
15146,,1,But it was such a lie.
15147,,1,And he has been so great.
15148,,1,Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK?
15149,,1,Better.. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?.
15150,,1,I think everything's is out of date.
15151,,1,We have a whole new world.
15152,,1,"When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked."
15153,,1,Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right.
15154,,1,You know what?
15155,,1,"We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago."
15156,,1,Today we have a different threat.
15157,,1,We have a terror threat.
15158,,1,And we have an ISIS threat.
15159,,1,"And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned."
15160,,1,It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention.
15161,,1,And everyone's talking about it.
15162,,1,The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.Go ahead.. What would you renegotiate  the enhanced interrogation aspect of it?
15163,,1,The .
15164,,1,"I would Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything."
15165,,1,"I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy."
15166,,1,I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain.
15167,,1,They're not living up to the bargain.
15168,,1,"And everyone agrees with me, except for the media.And the media never says that."
15169,,1,"I like NATO, just so you understand."
15170,,1,I like NATO.
15171,,1,I like the concept of NATO.
15172,,1,It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should.
15173,,1,I've been saying this for six months now.
15174,,1,"A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, ""We are going to cover terror,"" they announced somebody.I think NATO's great."
15175,,1,But it's got to be modernized.
15176,,1,And and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying.. On the Geneva Convention  ..
15177,,1,Yes?.
15178,,1,"Do you think that they should allow for that, given the  ?."
15179,,1,"I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes.And by the way, it works..   will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia?"
15180,,1,According to .
15181,,1,I'll tell you what.
15182,,1,Let me say it once again.
15183,,1,Let me say it once again.
15184,,1,OK?
15185,,1,"Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe."
15186,,1,And they can afford to pay this.
15187,,1,It's not like they can't afford it.They just see us as a soft touch.
15188,,1,"You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch."
15189,,1,"I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes."
15190,,1,"But in business, they call them a soft touch."
15191,,1,They haven't paid us.
15192,,1,OK?
15193,,1,I want them to pay.Excuse me.
15194,,1,I'm not saying anything.
15195,,1,I don't talk.
15196,,1,I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that.
15197,,1,I don't talk.
15198,,1,"But they're going to pay.No, no yeah, it sends a signal."
15199,,1,You know what signal it says?
15200,,1,"It says we're going to pay.You know, somebody said, ""but we have treaties."""
15201,,1,I said that's right.
15202,,1,"And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay."
15203,,1,They're going to pay.
15204,,1,And they will pay.
15205,,1,They will pay.
15206,,1,.
15207,,1,Yes?.
15208,,1,how are you planning to  ?.
15209,,1,We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks.
15210,,1,I'm going to be doing a big thing on that.
15211,,1,.
15212,,1,"Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community."
15213,,1,"I mean, really well."
15214,,1,"I mean, the the poll numbers are going up very high."
15215,,1,I think we had one recently 35 or 36.
15216,,1,"But I'm going to have a whole we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks.So, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up."
15217,,1,They're all way up.
15218,,1,Biggest they say the biggest bounce in memory.
15219,,1,"Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, ""Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce."""
15220,,1,"So, you know, I have to at least say.Jeremy, go ahead..   do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton?."
15221,,1,I don't think he respects Clinton.
15222,,1,I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton.
15223,,1,I think he does respect me.
15224,,1,And I hope I get along great with him.
15225,,1,"It's possible that we won't, Jeremy."
15226,,1,"I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.Right now, we don't have a good relationship."
15227,,1,Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things.
15228,,1,OK?
15229,,1,"He mentioned the ""N"" word one time."
15230,,1,"I was shocked to hear him mention the ""N"" word."
15231,,1,"You know what the ""N"" word is, right?"
15232,,1,He mentioned it.
15233,,1,I was shocked.He has a total lack of respect for President Obama.
15234,,1,"Number one, he doesn't like him."
15235,,1,"And number two, he doesn't respect him."
15236,,1,I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected.
15237,,1,And I hope he likes me.Yes?
15238,,1,"Yes, sir?."
15239,,1,relations?.
15240,,1,"Yes, sir."
15241,,1,.
15242,,1,But let me finish with Jeremy.
15243,,1,Go ahead.. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than  ?.
15244,,1,President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations.
15245,,1,You can't be worse.
15246,,1,"Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China."
15247,,1,"Well, they're united now, in a true sense."
15248,,1,They've never been closer.They're selling oil to China.
15249,,1,We forced them into this position.
15250,,1,.
15251,,1,"No, wait a minute."
15252,,1,.
15253,,1,"No, I'm not going to be an adversary."
15254,,1,"No, not at all."
15255,,1,I have tenants from China.
15256,,1,I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent.
15257,,1,"I mean, I have great relationships with China."
15258,,1,I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder.
15259,,1,I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent.
15260,,1,We don't know what we're doing.I don't blame I respect China.
15261,,1,"Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them.I have no problem with China."
15262,,1,I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen.
15263,,1,And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama.
15264,,1,"I think it will get worse.It's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that."
15265,,1,"But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama.Yes?."
15266,,1,you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable.. That's right..
15267,,1,Working on a plan .
15268,,1,"That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so.. Are you prepared to give us any sort of ."
15269,,1,"No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan."
15270,,1,"One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say.But I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people."
15271,,1,"This is such a great country, these are such great people."
15272,,1,"one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job.Number one, they get out, they have no jobs."
15273,,1,"Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place."
15274,,1,They're not coming here.
15275,,1,"Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much.And the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their up to their neck."
15276,,1,"They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life."
15277,,1,"They have loans.And I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it."
15278,,1,"Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher.Because college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make?"
15279,,1,"If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges.Because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it."
15280,,1,So the colleges are costing so much money.
15281,,1,We are going to help the students.
15282,,1,Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework.But I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it.
15283,,1,We have to help our students.
15284,,1,"Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick.Our students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students."
15285,,1,And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks.
15286,,1,.
15287,,1,talking about possibly .
15288,,1,"Everything's on the table, you'll see."
15289,,1,"Everything it's a very important it's a very important subject.Yes, ma'am?."
15290,,1,"Mr. Trump,  .."
15291,,1,"I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country."
15292,,1,"Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people.I think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it."
15293,,1,"And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment.And I think people see that."
15294,,1,"I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly you people know because you're there the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Because Obamacare is a disaster."
15295,,1,"In Texas, going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase."
15296,,1,"On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases."
15297,,1,President Obama is trying to get it moved to December.
15298,,1,Because it is election-defying.
15299,,1,"It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care."
15300,,1,"It's going to be announced on November 1st.I just asked the press, don't let him do that."
15301,,1,"Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it."
15302,,1,"It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway.In '17 unfortunately if I'm president I mean I've got to take over this mess."
15303,,1,"It's going to fold, anyway."
15304,,1,"But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it.They like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted."
15305,,1,"Those are the things that are resonating.And they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it.John, go ahead, John..   Russia has no business in you that you don't have any ."
15306,,1,"No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John."
15307,,1,How many times do I have say that?
15308,,1,Are you a smart man?
15309,,1,"I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.And even for anything."
15310,,1,What do I have to do with Russia?
15311,,1,"You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida.Palm Beach is a very expensive place."
15312,,1,There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions.
15313,,1,So I sold it.
15314,,1,"So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian."
15315,,1,That was a number of years ago.
15316,,1,"I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?."
15317,,1,.
15318,,1,Of course I can.
15319,,1,"I told you, other than normal stuff I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian."
15320,,1,I have nothing to do with Russia.
15321,,1,"I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?."
15322,,1,.
15323,,1,Of course not.
15324,,1,I own the Trump organization.
15325,,1,"Zero, zero."
15326,,1,Go ahead..  .
15327,,1,I am..  .
15328,,1,I did..  .
15329,,1,I did.
15330,,1,Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States.
15331,,1,But she would be so wrong.
15332,,1,And even women say that.
15333,,1,Women don't like her.
15334,,1,She would be so wrong.
15335,,1,"Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster."
15336,,1,She's been a disaster.
15337,,1,"And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter."
15338,,1,"I won't get into that.The chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard."
15339,,1,And he left it out.
15340,,1,"Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster."
15341,,1,"I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely."
15342,,1,But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton.
15343,,1,Yes ma'am?.
15344,,1,.
15345,,1,"Yes, I do..  ."
15346,,1,"But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained."
15347,,1,"I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota."
15348,,1,I speak about it all the time.
15349,,1,"It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks."
15350,,1,"It's a real problem.You don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night."
15351,,1,The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time.
15352,,1,"Yes, ma'am, go ahead..  ."
15353,,1,"Oh, go ahead, go ahead..  ."
15354,,1,Yes..  .
15355,,1,"No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians."
15356,,1,I have no idea.
15357,,1,It's probably not Russia.
15358,,1,Nobody knows if it's Russia.
15359,,1,You know the sad thing is?
15360,,1,"That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails."
15361,,1,"We don't even know who it is.I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China."
15362,,1,"Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q."
15363,,1,"that can't get up in the morning, OK?"
15364,,1,Nobody knows.
15365,,1,Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia.
15366,,1,Might be Russia.
15367,,1,"But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States."
15368,,1,"Yes, ma'am..  ."
15369,,1,Yes..  .
15370,,1,"Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there."
15371,,1,That's something really bad going on.
15372,,1,"And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it."
15373,,1,He's still not using it.
15374,,1,And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it.
15375,,1,She said she will use it but so far she didn't.She'll probably use it tonight.
15376,,1,"Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace."
15377,,1,You had a room with a massive stage without flags.
15378,,1,I think this I think that the people in the community know what's going on.
15379,,1,Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people.
15380,,1,"When you look at San Bernardino, people knew many people knew what was going on."
15381,,1,They had bombs lying all over the floor.
15382,,1,They had bombs on the floor.
15383,,1,"I mean, this isn't you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor I think there's a problem there."
15384,,1,"You got to report it.And by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK?"
15385,,1,"David Hinckley was just released John Hinckley I think that John Hinckley excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed."
15386,,1,I just heard about it.
15387,,1,.
15388,,1,"Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government Russia, China, anybody to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country ."
15389,,1,That's up to the President.
15390,,1,Let the President talk to them.
15391,,1,"Look, here's the problem."
15392,,1,"Here's the problem, Katy."
15393,,1,"Katy, here's the problem, very simple."
15394,,1,He has no respect .
15395,,1,"30,000 e-mails ."
15396,,1,"Well, they probably have them."
15397,,1,I'd like to have them released..
15398,,1,Does that not give you pause?.
15399,,1,"No, it gives me no pause."
15400,,1,"If they have them, they have them."
15401,,1,"We might as well hey, you know what gives me more pause?"
15402,,1,"That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton here's what gives me pause."
15403,,1,Be quiet.
15404,,1,I know you want to save her.
15405,,1,"That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails."
15406,,1,That gives me a big problem.
15407,,1,After she gets a subpoena!
15408,,1,"She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails?"
15409,,1,That gives me a problem.
15410,,1,"Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them."
15411,,1,.
15412,,1,"A question about Mike Pence, because ""The New York Times"" reported that   conversation with John Kasich's campaign,   says, you can be the most powerful   ."
15413,,1,That's the most ridiculous conversation.
15414,,1,He never had the Don Jr. told me let me just tell you.
15415,,1,Let me save you a lot of boredom..   Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected?.
15416,,1,"Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich."
15417,,1,I never spoke to him about being vice president.
15418,,1,We don't have good chemistry together.
15419,,1,I have never spoken to him about being vice president.
15420,,1,I would never pick him to be vice president.
15421,,1,"There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky."
15422,,1,"He never spoke Don Jr. would never and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point."
15423,,1,"Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy."
15424,,1,"I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous."
15425,,1,"And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy."
15426,,1,So what's left for the president?
15427,,1,I think you know me better than that.
15428,,1,That was put out by him.
15429,,1,"He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine."
15430,,1,He's fine.
15431,,1,"I would never have chosen him.Now, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people."
15432,,1,"There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job.Let me just explain I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I."
15433,,1,"And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points..  ."
15434,,1,It probably has.
15435,,1,It probably has.
15436,,1,Our government is so weak on this stuff.
15437,,1,It probably has.
15438,,1,Possible.
15439,,1,"I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance."
15440,,1,"I have a good system, I guess."
15441,,1,"I'm not an e- mail person, myself."
15442,,1,"I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing."
15443,,1,"But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never."
15444,,1,I'm just not a believer in e-mail.
15445,,1,"A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary."
15446,,1,"But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked."
15447,,1,Who knows?.
15448,,1,broken the rules in traditional American politics many times.
15449,,1,while the other person .
15450,,1,"Yes, but my message wasn't dark."
15451,,1,"My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems."
15452,,1,Go ahead..  .
15453,,1,"OK.. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week."
15454,,1,What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet .
15455,,1,No basis.
15456,,1,"No basis.Look, John, I didn't have to do this."
15457,,1,"When I did this, believe me you see this incredible resort."
15458,,1,It's one of the great in the world.
15459,,1,"When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself."
15460,,1,I don't have to be with you guys.
15461,,1,I didn't need this.
15462,,1,"I have places that are the best in the world, OK."
15463,,1,I could be doing other things.
15464,,1,I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again.
15465,,1,"I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China."
15466,,1,"And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets."
15467,,1,We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards.When I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it.
15468,,1,You know this country's been great to me.
15469,,1,I'm giving back.
15470,,1,"That's all.Now as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical."
15471,,1,"But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17."
15472,,1,"Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people."
15473,,1,Wait a minute.
15474,,1,"Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing."
15475,,1,"He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner.And then I won New Hampshire."
15476,,1,And then I won you know 38 or 39 states.
15477,,1,"And won by the way, not by a little bit."
15478,,1,Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party.
15479,,1,So just .
15480,,1,.
15481,,1,"OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign."
15482,,1,But it's what I think is good.
15483,,1,I think it's good.
15484,,1,I think it's working here too..
15485,,1,But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns.
15486,,1,"And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were   ."
15487,,1,"Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb."
15488,,1,He used the term carpet bomb.
15489,,1,"When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that."
15490,,1,That was Ted Cruz that said that OK?
15491,,1,"That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me.When Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade."
15492,,1,"But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie."
15493,,1,So I have a choice.
15494,,1,"All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter."
15495,,1,I say to me it does matter.
15496,,1,"It matters.When people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians."
15497,,1,"But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone."
15498,,1,In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that.
15499,,1,"Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders."
15500,,1,And you guys know that I didn't.
15501,,1,"In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.So it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president."
15502,,1,"Today on ""The Today Show"" he said, this is democracy."
15503,,1,A little bit different.
15504,,1,Little bit different.
15505,,1,"David, go ahead Dave.. Last night at the Democratic Convention   women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage."
15506,,1,Can you clarify your position on those?.
15507,,1,You'll have to see it in the polls David.
15508,,1,You know what my positions are.
15509,,1,You'll have to see it at the polls..
15510,,1,I don't know what  .
15511,,1,Yeah go ahead.
15512,,1,.
15513,,1,David my positions are down.
15514,,1,You ask the question every single time.
15515,,1,I give you an answer.
15516,,1,My positions are down.
15517,,1,Take a look.
15518,,1,Go ahead..
15519,,1,Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant ?.
15520,,1,Yes I did.. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations .
15521,,1,"We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said."
15522,,1,But we wanted  .
15523,,1,"Excuse me, listen."
15524,,1,We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia.
15525,,1,It was a tremendous success.
15526,,1,"Very, very successful."
15527,,1,And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia.
15528,,1,And they wanted us to do it.
15529,,1,But it never worked out.Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons.
15530,,1,"But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places."
15531,,1,But we decided not to do it.
15532,,1,.
15533,,1,Yes ma'am go ahead..   President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency.
15534,,1,Last night he said that anything is possible..
15535,,1,He did say that.. What is your reaction to that?.
15536,,1,"Well, I just said sort of said that."
15537,,1,He just said that.
15538,,1,"He said it this morning, anything's possible."
15539,,1,I think I'm going to win.
15540,,1,I think people are sick and tired of incompetence.
15541,,1,They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes.
15542,,1,"Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things."
15543,,1,And that's why.
15544,,1,I mean I think I'll win the election.
15545,,1,I think you'll see that in the polls.All right a few more questions.
15546,,1,Go ahead John.. Back in December .
15547,,1,I hope your arm's OK..
15548,,1,It's all right.
15549,,1,Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership.
15550,,1,"Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip ."
15551,,1,"Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional."
15552,,1,But I have great support from Israel.
15553,,1,I will back Israel 100 percent.
15554,,1,I would like to go there.
15555,,1,"But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel.And by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel."
15556,,1,He has been a disaster for Israel.
15557,,1,.
15558,,1,I don't know.
15559,,1,I don't know.
15560,,1,I haven't set my schedule yet.
15561,,1,It could happen..   you are the nominee.
15562,,1,"Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running  ?."
15563,,1,"No, I think we it's possible we have."
15564,,1,But I'm not I'm only interested in winning.
15565,,1,"Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage."
15566,,1,"I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership."
15567,,1,"And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.I'll get along great with the leadership."
15568,,1,"And we'll do well.Yes, ma'am, in the back?."
15569,,1,"Mr. Trump,   ."
15570,,1,"No, no."
15571,,1,Excuse me.
15572,,1,In the back?.
15573,,1,"I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize   Crimea as Russian territory?"
15574,,1,And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are  ?.
15575,,1,We'll be looking at that.
15576,,1,"Yeah, we'll be looking.Go ahead.. Mr. Trump,   questions."
15577,,1,"First, a quick one on the minimum wage."
15578,,1,You said we need to raise it to $10.
15579,,1,be clear here.
15580,,1,Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?.
15581,,1,Federal.. OK. Second question about  ..
15582,,1,Right.. You said  .
15583,,1,Would religion be a part of the  ?.
15584,,1,I'm not making it a part.
15585,,1,"But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part.OK."
15586,,1,.
15587,,1,"Yes, ma'am?"
15588,,1,Go ahead..  .
15589,,1,Who said that?.
15590,,1,.
15591,,1,Who?.
15592,,1,.
15593,,1,I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history.
15594,,1,"His views of the world, as he says, don't jive."
15595,,1,And the world is a mess.
15596,,1,"You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched."
15597,,1,He has been a disaster as a president.
15598,,1,He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country.
15599,,1,It is a mess.And I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse.Go ahead..   polls you  .
15600,,1,"You just said  .. Oh,   just said that?"
15601,,1,Many polls show that you are winning?
15602,,1,I can't believe it.
15603,,1,Are you Katy Turek of NBC?
15604,,1,It's a disguise.Go ahead.
15605,,1,.
15606,,1,Many polls show you  .
15607,,1,He said he feels that you are   not prepared to be president.
15608,,1,Can you   lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis?
15609,,1,How does your  ?.
15610,,1,"OK. Well,  ."
15611,,1,.
15612,,1,about what's going on   and domestic affairs.. Sure.
15613,,1,"Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times."
15614,,1,I've turned out to be right.
15615,,1,I turned out to be right on NATO.
15616,,1,"After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me.Excuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals."
15617,,1,She never said that in her life.
15618,,1,She said it yesterday only because of me.
15619,,1,I'm the one that's prepared.
15620,,1,"President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything."
15621,,1,This guy didn't know a thing.
15622,,1,"And honestly, today he knows less."
15623,,1,"Today, he knows less.He's done a terrible job."
15624,,1,"I think I'm very prepared.Now, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it."
15625,,1,I've been seeing it.
15626,,1,I've been feeling.
15627,,1,"And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side."
15628,,1,I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here.
15629,,1,"I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people..   advisers, though?."
15630,,1,I do.
15631,,1,I have great foreign advisers.
15632,,1,And you have a list.
15633,,1,And I gave you a list.
15634,,1,"And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many we have so many."
15635,,1,"As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers.Now, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names."
15636,,1,Look at the mess they've gotten us into.
15637,,1,"They said, ""Have you spoken to so and so?"""
15638,,1,"Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of."
15639,,1,Have you spoken to this one or that one?
15640,,1,"I said, they were all look at the job they've done.So a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good."
15641,,1,Because look at the end result.
15642,,1,The end result is our country is a mess.
15643,,1,The Middle East has never been worse.
15644,,1,"Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an ""S,"" gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now.All right, Tom."
15645,,1,A couple more.
15646,,1,"Go ahead, Tom..   security briefings."
15647,,1,"You're about to get one.. Yeah.. Do you expect your opinion on   or your opinion on  .. Well, we'll have to see."
15648,,1,"I mean, that's my opinion."
15649,,1,That's my opinion.
15650,,1,We'll have to see.
15651,,1,"I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings."
15652,,1,"How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent."
15653,,1,"It was negligent.Now why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings?"
15654,,1,Because it's going to get revealed.
15655,,1,"I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert."
15656,,1,"And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right?I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK?"
15657,,1,"So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning."
15658,,1,"So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff.I don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out..  ."
15659,,1,No.
15660,,1,He's not going to run for mayor.
15661,,1,"Oh, Don?"
15662,,1,He's not going to run for mayor.
15663,,1,Don has no attention of running for mayor.
15664,,1,But he did a great job the other night with his speech.
15665,,1,"Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor."
15666,,1,You know why?
15667,,1,"Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio."
15668,,1,But Don is not going to run for he has no interest in running for mayor..  .
15669,,1,Yes.
15670,,1,.
15671,,1,.
15672,,1,Unbelievable what he said.
15673,,1,I think it's disgraceful.
15674,,1,"Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen."
15675,,1,But we all know it is going to happen if she won.
15676,,1,"Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen."
15677,,1,"And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK?"
15678,,1,Go ahead..  .
15679,,1,"Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really Anthony Weiner's look, look, look Anthony Weiner is a proven loser."
15680,,1,"I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room."
15681,,1,"They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out."
15682,,1,I don't know what Anthony my son doesn't want to run for mayor.
15683,,1,"He has no intention of running for mayor.And besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area."
15684,,1,It's almost impossible for a Republican to win.
15685,,1,"So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed."
15686,,1,Go ahead..  .
15687,,1,"Yes, in   very sad."
15688,,1,Not  ..  .
15689,,1,"Yes, I'm looking at it."
15690,,1,I actually want to find out what causes it.
15691,,1,"It's a problem in many areas, OK?"
15692,,1,"Yes, go ahead..  ."
15693,,1,"Well, they shouted you know what was interesting."
15694,,1,"Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before."
15695,,1,"And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, ""Lock her up!"
15696,,1,Lock her up!
15697,,1,"Lock her up."""
15698,,1,"They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made."
15699,,1,"The big speech.. And I said, ""Don't do that."""
15700,,1,"Now, I didn't do that for any reason."
15701,,1,I really I didn't like it.
15702,,1,And they stopped.
15703,,1,Not one reporter said that I said that.
15704,,1,"They all said they started screaming ""Lock her up!"
15705,,1,"Lock her up."""
15706,,1,"I said, ""Don't do that."""
15707,,1,"Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting.You do agree I said that, right?."
15708,,1,"You did say that.. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that?."
15709,,1,"That's what I want to ask you about, you said you ."
15710,,1,"No, I think it's I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.OK, one more question, yes yes, ma'am, go ahead.."
15711,,1,"Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that   immigration.This is Doral, it was built by ."
15712,,1,"Well, Doral is great."
15713,,1,"And Doral I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job.Yes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead."
15714,,1,Yellow..
15715,,1,I have another question..
15716,,1,Excuse me.
15717,,1,Yellow.. Hillary Clinton's running mate .
15718,,1,Who?.
15719,,1,Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish.
15720,,1,Do you think this   an advantage on .
15721,,1,"No, I don't think it has any impact."
15722,,1,"He's been very bad her running mate has been very, very bad on employment."
15723,,1,"And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad.I figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia."
15724,,1,They don't like him.
15725,,1,They don't like him.
15726,,1,"It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad.So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much."
15727,,1,"I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does.Thank you all very much..   running for the president  ?."
15728,,1,Might as well tell him to have a good time.
15729,,1,"He has done one bad job.OK, thank you, everybody."
15730,,1,So how good is he?
15731,,1,How good is he?
15732,,1,[ ] Special.
15733,,1,Special.
15734,,1,He is a special man and special person.
15735,,1,And he has become my friend.
15736,,1,"Oh, there is a lot of people here."
15737,,1,Whoa.
15738,,1,"Hello, everybody."
15739,,1,Your football team is going to have a great year.
15740,,1,I watch.
15741,,1,I watch.
15742,,1,"You've got the quarterback, you've got the whole deal."
15743,,1,I think it's going to be a very good year.
15744,,1,OK?
15745,,1,"And if you get into that Super Bowl, I will be going, all right?So, you know, I wrote something down before, and I think it is important, because -- I love you too."
15746,,1,"Because we need unity, we have to win this election."
15747,,1,"This is truly one of the most important elections, certainly in my lifetime."
15748,,1,"Because we are about to go -- we lose it, we are in the wrong direction, and maybe it's gone."
15749,,1,"Supreme Court justices, always remember that."
15750,,1,"But so many different levels, and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today, it was a disaster."
15751,,1,A disaster.
15752,,1,She had a disaster.
15753,,1,"She lies folks, she lies badly."
15754,,1,"So, I want to -- I just wrote this out."
15755,,1,"I wanted to say to the group, you know, I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin, and I did not quite eke it out."
15756,,1,"I thought I was going to, but after that, it worked out well."
15757,,1,"You built me up, you taught me about politics."
15758,,1,"And when I left here, I said, I think I've learned a lot."
15759,,1,"So, I love it."
15760,,1,I love the people.
15761,,1,I have many friends in Wisconsin.
15762,,1,And they're -- they're incredible people.
15763,,1,"You're incredible people, I have to tell you that."
15764,,1,And we're going to have a lot of fun.
15765,,1,We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this.
15766,,1,This campaign is not about me or any one candidate.
15767,,1,It is about America.
15768,,1,It is time for a change.
15769,,1,We need a change.
15770,,1,"A real change, not an Obama change."
15771,,1,We don't need an Obama change.
15772,,1,We have had enough.
15773,,1,"It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders, and replace it with a government that serves the people."
15774,,1,Have to do it.
15775,,1,And know both sides.
15776,,1,I've been on the other side.
15777,,1,Believe me.
15778,,1,I actually like this side better; this is a movement.
15779,,1,"This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country, according to even the political pundits that truly hate me, OK?"
15780,,1,"This is a -- they -- oh, this is a movement that some say, most say is one of the great phenomenon's that they've ever seen in politics."
15781,,1,Some say it's the single greatest phenomenon.
15782,,1,"Though the media doesn't want to talk about it, we have done something -- we."
15783,,1,"All of us, together."
15784,,1,I'm a messenger; I'm only a messenger.
15785,,1,"We have done something truly historic together, standing before you as nominee for president and I'm not a politician, proudly."
15786,,1,I'm not part of the system.
15787,,1,"I ran against the system, and I'm probably better off running against the system."
15788,,1,I ran against the donors.
15789,,1,"I'm my own donor, essentially."
15790,,1,I have a lot of money under this deal.
15791,,1,"This is a very expensive crisis, I want to tell you."
15792,,1,"I funded -- as you know, I funded the primaries."
15793,,1,"And I'm in for under $60 million, and I'm largely funding my campaign as we go forward."
15794,,1,"In addition to that -- in addition to that, we have raised tremendous amounts of money, and much of it from small donors,$61; $61."
15795,,1,"As a Republican, that doesn't happen."
15796,,1,It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.
15797,,1,"And if you remember, just prior to June, they did a story, ""Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising."""
15798,,1,"Well, that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination."
15799,,1,I'm not going to raise funds -- I would've had enough if I didn't make it.
15800,,1,"I would have said, ""Bye, bye, politics."""
15801,,1,But I wanted to make sure -- so I got it.
15802,,1,And then I started raising money for the Republican Party.
15803,,1,and we raised a lot of money.
15804,,1,"We started really on June 14th, Flag Day, my birthday."
15805,,1,My birthday.
15806,,1,"And in June, we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million."
15807,,1,Can you imagine?
15808,,1,And those people couldn't believe it; they were really surprised.
15809,,1,"Big headlines, you know."
15810,,1,Because they don't give me too many good headlines.
15811,,1,I could do the greatest things.
15812,,1,I do things that I think a fantastic.
15813,,1,"I say, good, there is no way they cover this badly."
15814,,1,And they cover it badly.
15815,,1,"I gently tell a woman that I love her baby, and let the baby cry."
15816,,1,"It is OK. As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember, I told her to stay, don't worry, ma'am."
15817,,1,"But after about 3 or 4 minutes, and I'm trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville, we had this massive, massive crowd, filled up the stadium."
15818,,1,And the baby's screaming.
15819,,1,"So, I said, ma'am, I would like to reverse my order."
15820,,1,Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out.
15821,,1,Your baby is greatI did it so nicely.
15822,,1,She was happy.
15823,,1,Even the baby was happy.
15824,,1,He stopped crying.
15825,,1,"And maybe you could take the baby out, would that be possible?"
15826,,1,The whole place was cracking up.
15827,,1,"And the next day in the newspaper, it said, ""Trump throws baby out of arena."""
15828,,1,Terrible.
15829,,1,"Now, they are very dishonest."
15830,,1,"That was a tough one, when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me, backstage, a reporter come up -- ""Mr. Trump, sir, but why did you throw that baby out of the area?"""
15831,,1,"I said, ""I was having fun."
15832,,1,"I was so nice, I was so nice."
15833,,1,Everybody likes me.
15834,,1,"The baby liked me, the mother liked me."
15835,,1,We had a good time.
15836,,1,"I try to keep the baby in, but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice  In fact, I want to find out who that baby is, because I want to sponsor the baby."
15837,,1,And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall.
15838,,1,I'm telling you.
15839,,1,New York City.
15840,,1,OK?
15841,,1,The great Philharmonic.
15842,,1,"So, I'm not part of the system."
15843,,1,I ran against the system.
15844,,1,"I ran against the donors, because I'm largely my own donor."
15845,,1,I'm running against myself.
15846,,1,That's sort of -- never thought of it that way.
15847,,1,"And against the status quo, and the status quo, we have to get rid of, because it is not working, folks, because the country is a mess."
15848,,1,And that is why put up a lot of money.
15849,,1,"But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests, and really a candidate of total corruption, I mean, you take a look at what she is doing, the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very, very corrupt the system."
15850,,1,It is a corrupt system.
15851,,1,It's a corrupt system.
15852,,1,"You want something done, they can do it for you."
15853,,1,"And that is not necessarily, and usually it isn't good for the country.That is why we're going to be able to deliver real change, and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans."
15854,,1,We have to unite.
15855,,1,"Remember that.Everything I've accomplished, I have done by putting together a really fantastic team, including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who has done an incredible   Done an incredible job."
15856,,1,"My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing, and they are working so hard."
15857,,1,"My family, friends, and it's expanding all the time."
15858,,1,But I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make.
15859,,1,"We have to make them, right?"
15860,,1,"I understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan's big tent within the party, big, big tent, remember?"
15861,,1,"Ronald Reagan, great man, great guy."
15862,,1,"Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans, a lot of people."
15863,,1,We're going to have the same thing.
15864,,1,"There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room, are there a lot of Democrats?"
15865,,1,Raise your hands.
15866,,1,"I mean, I don't think we need too many to be honest with you, but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy, Ronald Reagan."
15867,,1,"Stated by Ronald Reagan, pretty good.We will be the big tent party."
15868,,1,We are going to have a lot of cross help.
15869,,1,"We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade, because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade."
15870,,1,"Trade is a disaster with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Vietnam, with so many countries, with every country, every country."
15871,,1,"We don't win at any level with anything, and as a unified party, we will lead our country to unity as well, very important."
15872,,1,"We need the unity, we have to win the election."
15873,,1,No we have to win it --- have to win it.
15874,,1,"Otherwise, our big movement was not as big as we thought and that's not good."
15875,,1,"That's why November 8th, you've got to get everybody you know -- and you know, all this voter ID nowadays, a lot of places aren't going to have voter ID."
15876,,1,Now what does that mean?
15877,,1,What does that mean?
15878,,1,You just keep walking in and voting?
15879,,1,"So you have to be very careful, very vigilant -- you have to be carefulBut we will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory, and very importantly, toward real change."
15880,,1,"So in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan."
15881,,1,"Paul Ryan, he's good."
15882,,1,He's a good man.
15883,,1,He's a good man and he's a good guy.
15884,,1,"And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree and we're going get it done and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things."
15885,,1,He's a good man.
15886,,1,"And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election."
15887,,1,Very important.
15888,,1,We'll work together.
15889,,1,I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.
15890,,1,"A state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire."
15891,,1,"No, I love New Hampshire, one of the most beautiful places."
15892,,1,"She's a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time."
15893,,1,Senator Kelly Ayotte.
15894,,1,"Working hand-in-hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate."
15895,,1,"We need that, we've got to get things done."
15896,,1,"Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster, which is exactly what it is, that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world, that's what's happening."
15897,,1,"You saw it just now, Maps came out yesterday, they said ISIS far bigger, it's all over the place."
15898,,1,It's all over the place.
15899,,1,"We're going to get rid of it, folks."
15900,,1,Our military is depleted.
15901,,1,"We're going to build up our military, we are going to get others with us."
15902,,1,"Believe me, we're going to get plenty of others with us."
15903,,1,"And speaking of others, wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia?"
15904,,1,Wouldn't that be nice?
15905,,1,"They talk so big and so brave and so tough, they're the tough ones."
15906,,1,"You know, Hillary's real tough, give me a break."
15907,,1,Wouldn't that be great?
15908,,1,"We get along with Russia, we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great?"
15909,,1,"Together we will lead our country back to prosperity, security and peace."
15910,,1,OK?
15911,,1,"When you look at the world and what's happened -- so we have the queen of corruption, she's the queen of corruption."
15912,,1,She is a disaster.
15913,,1,"I said before, if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president, terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country."
15914,,1,"Believe me, they are loving it."
15915,,1,She wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation.
15916,,1,"And we don't know who they are, we don't know where they come from really, we don't know if they're ISIS, some will be."
15917,,1,"And look at the damage that's done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple, and these were friends of theirs."
15918,,1,"These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down, 14 people killed, many, many injured."
15919,,1,"Take a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando, how disgusting that was."
15920,,1,Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places.
15921,,1,"Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, go to Paris and take a look at that, 130 people gunned down."
15922,,1,"You know, if people had guns, on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction, like you sir, you sir, you and you, ma'am."
15923,,1,"First of all, if they knew guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have gone there."
15924,,1,There were no guns.
15925,,1,"They were just sitting ducks, 130 people."
15926,,1,In San Bernardino you had 14 people.
15927,,1,"But in Paris, just like this, boom -- get over here, boom -- get over here, boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital, many so gravely wounded."
15928,,1,It's horrible.
15929,,1,"And if they had bullets flying in the other direction, maybe they wouldn't have shown up, and if they did, I'll tell you what, you wouldn't have had that kind of carnage."
15930,,1,You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead.
15931,,1,"So Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage, as you know, to our Second Amendment."
15932,,1,"Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- she's going to make them nice and liberal, wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights."
15933,,1,Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment.
15934,,1,"You will not recognize it, you will not recognize it."
15935,,1,"National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me."
15936,,1,"They're great people, Wayne -- they're great people, Chris, they love this country."
15937,,1,They endorsed me very early and it's really a -- it's really an honor.
15938,,1,"I'll tell you what, they are phenomenal people when you get to know them."
15939,,1,"They love the country -- you know, they love the country."
15940,,1,"They take a lot of heat, but they love the country, I'll tell you that right now."
15941,,1,"And I heard Mike, Governor Pence, talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth, the lowest in memory since the 1940's."
15942,,1,"When you think about it, it's the lowest."
15943,,1,"So a lot of differences between all of us, but I thought I would mention -- because I've known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements."
15944,,1,She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.
15945,,1,"Well, let's see, ""we can't get them for this -- can't get them for this."""
15946,,1,"I've always heard that I have the best temperament, people tell me I have the best temperament, I have a temperament to win."
15947,,1,We got to win.
15948,,1,"We got to win  She said not so long ago, ""I don't like Donald Trump's tone""."
15949,,1,"Now, she is reading it off teleprompters only."
15950,,1,I don't like Donald trump's tone.
15951,,1,"And I said, you know, ""we need a tough tone today."
15952,,1,"We have people -- we need a kind tone, but we need a tough tone."""
15953,,1,We have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places.
15954,,1,We have crime that is rampant.
15955,,1,We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages.
15956,,1,"This is like medieval times, and she is worried about my tone."
15957,,1,"So they chop off heads and they drown people, and they bury people in sand."
15958,,1,"And then they ask me, ""Mr. Trump, sir,"" -- at one of the debates in which I won, I'm very happy about that -- ""Mr. Trump, sir, how do you feel about waterboarding?"""
15959,,1,"I'm seeing chopped off heads, drowned people, burying in sand -- I said, ""I'm absolutely OK with it, let me tell you."""
15960,,1,"Can you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- ""come back, get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States, waterboarding is not allowed."""
15961,,1,"Folks, we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary, we are playing games."
15962,,1,"It is just games, she is not the right person and everybody knows it."
15963,,1,Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it.
15964,,1,"This is true, 33,000 e-mails."
15965,,1,So I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that's very full and very nice in Iowa.
15966,,1,"And we love Iowa don't we, yes?"
15967,,1,Right?
15968,,1,"I thought it was accurate, unstable -- and she is, she is unstable."
15969,,1,Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had.
15970,,1,"You just have to pay attention, as soon as he said it, I started writing notes."
15971,,1,"She has bad judgment.
She lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country.
Plus, she is a weak person."
15972,,1,We don't need a weak person.
15973,,1,"He just said, ""plus, she is a criminal."
15974,,1,"She is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans, and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy.
We have a long way to go.
She is unhinged, she's truly unhinged, and she is unbalanced, totally unbalanced.
And you can see, in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book, I bought the book, I wanted to see what he had to say; she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office."""
15975,,1,"From my bottom of my soul he said, ""I know this to be true."""
15976,,1,He was there.
15977,,1,"Her leadership style, volcanic impulsive as it is, disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit.
She's unqualified to become president."
15978,,1,"And she really is, and Bernie said that too."
15979,,1,Thank you.
15980,,1,What great people.
15981,,1,"Wow.No, but it is true, no games, it is true."
15982,,1,"In one way she is a monster, OK?"
15983,,1,"Look at what happened, look at her history."
15984,,1,"In another way, she is a weak person, she is actually not strong enough to be president."
15985,,1,"So she's got both, but she is not strong enough to be president."
15986,,1,She will be a be a disaster.
15987,,1,"She will be so bad for our country, and I'm not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court."
15988,,1,She will be so bad for our country and we can't let it happen.
15989,,1,We can't let it happen.
15990,,1,"You know, Mike Pence told me a story, and maybe I should not say it, but I found it interesting, but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that he's in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House."
15991,,1,"And he said ""he ran, he ran again and he ran again, and he won."""
15992,,1,"You have to hand it to him, this is the guy that does not give up."
15993,,1,He does not quit.
15994,,1,He never ever quits.
15995,,1,"But he watched the Clintons -- and I'm sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics, which is interesting.So then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal, horrible deal, we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it, $400 million in cash, different currencies, different denominations."
15996,,1,"Now, lot of people say that money went toward terrorI'm nicer than that, see, I don't have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have."
15997,,1,"I say, some of it went to terror, but a lot of it went into their bank accounts, believe me, that's the way it is."
15998,,1,"It went into their pockets, can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash?"
15999,,1,"You think they're giving that money to terror, they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it, but most of it they kept."
16000,,1,"I mean, the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling."
16001,,1,"I mean, you wouldn't think -- who can authorize such a thing?"
16002,,1,Where did they get it?
16003,,1,"What did they do, go to a bank teller and say, ""give me $400 million in cash?"
16004,,1,"I want to in euros, I want it in Swiss francs, wrap it up, we will come back in 10 minutes."""
16005,,1,"I mean, it is just inconceivable."
16006,,1,So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world.
16007,,1,"You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people, these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism."
16008,,1,For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.
16009,,1,"Now, Obama, just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie, that was a tremendous lie, remember?"
16010,,1,"You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor."
16011,,1,Really?
16012,,1,How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?
16013,,1,"Keep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks."
16014,,1,It is a disaster.
16015,,1,"By the way, it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent."
16016,,1,"And -- and honestly, I hope I win, because we will do a great job."
16017,,1,We are going to make America great again.
16018,,1,We're going to make America great again.
16019,,1,"But I actually think that regardless of who wins, Obamacare is going to fold in any event."
16020,,1,It is so expensive.
16021,,1,People can't afford it and the country can't afford it.
16022,,1,"Other than that, it is just wonderful."
16023,,1,"So, in Texas, they just had almost a 60 percent increase."
16024,,1,Now the increases are starting to come out.
16025,,1,The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st.
16026,,1,The election is November 8th.
16027,,1,"Folks, they want to delay it, because it is election-changing."
16028,,1,It is a mess.
16029,,1,"It is election changing, and they want to change it."
16030,,1,And we can't let that happen.Because the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical.
16031,,1,They are going to be astronomical.
16032,,1,"They're going to be so big, so horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan is terrible."
16033,,1,It's terrible.
16034,,1,"And we're going to take care of everybody, but we're going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country."
16035,,1,This plan is a total rip.
16036,,1,"It does not work, so it's going to fall, because economically, it is a disaster for the country, too.But what about people where they said they had a 30, 40, 50, 60 percent increase?"
16037,,1,"And it's going to be worse than that, I predict on November 1st.So, we'd better get smart and we'd better start thinking properly.Now, I want to talk about what is going on at the borders, because money   Oh, we're going to build it.So, listen, so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country ."
16038,,1,"We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.Most of the politicians, almost all of them don't even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people."
16039,,1,This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time.
16040,,1,And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama.
16041,,1,Right?
16042,,1,"So, tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day."
16043,,1,"If you think of this, I just wrote this, the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS."
16044,,1,Huge portions.
16045,,1,"It has undermined stability in Egypt, and you know what they have to do over there."
16046,,1,And empowered Iran as never before.
16047,,1,"Iran, three years ago was -- was dying."
16048,,1,"In fact, when they were marching in the streets, if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more, it would have been taken over by the people."
16049,,1,But Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now.
16050,,1,"Think of this, think of this."
16051,,1,"Look, look."
16052,,1,"We're making a deal, and the deal is not made, and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal."
16053,,1,"The leaders, and in particular the leader of Iran, is calling us stupid, and the deal means nothing.And yesterday, I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.This is our -- this is our great, great partner.But when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal, and if the other side was bragging about it, the deal wasn't made, I'm not making that deal."
16054,,1,I'm not making it.
16055,,1,I'm walking.
16056,,1,"But we kept it going, and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back."
16057,,1,OK?
16058,,1,We should have walked.
16059,,1,We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked.
16060,,1,And they would have -- and I say it.
16061,,1,"Before the plane reached New York City or Washington, you could just turn it around, because they'll call you, they'll say, let's go."
16062,,1,Take your hostages.
16063,,1,"But when you think about it, you probably read today and yesterday, one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time."
16064,,1,"Now, Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages."
16065,,1,That he would not do that for kidnappers.
16066,,1,He would not do that for kidnapping.
16067,,1,OK?
16068,,1,"No, no, think of that."
16069,,1,You have got to think about it.
16070,,1,"He wouldn't do it -- now, it was the same day, right, same day."
16071,,1,"We have to be exactly accurate, because they'll catch us, right?"
16072,,1,Same day.
16073,,1,"The money came in, and one of the hostages, a good guy, I saw him interview on television."
16074,,1,"Good guy, hard time."
16075,,1,"Btu didn't he say he waited forever, he waited."
16076,,1,"And somebody said, nope, we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in."
16077,,1,"And here Obama stands up yesterday, and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other."
16078,,1,Just a lie.
16079,,1,"You know, at least be truthful."
16080,,1,"And we're talking about the same day, $400 million, and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal."
16081,,1,"And you know what, I'm all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear."
16082,,1,But we could have made it -- we should have walked.
16083,,1,"And we should have walked with $150, too; we have said, sorry, we don't have the money, can't pay."
16084,,1,We don't have the money.
16085,,1,"We owe almost $20 trillionI'm sorry, fellas, we love you, we think you're the greatest guys on Earth."
16086,,1,But we can't give you the money.
16087,,1,We don't have it.
16088,,1,"And they will get angry and they will be upset, and two days later, you'll be back negotiating."
16089,,1,"You just saved yourself $150 billion, right?"
16090,,1,Hundred and -- $150 billion.
16091,,1,"So, we have terrorists pouring into our country, we have people coming in."
16092,,1,"I don't know if you saw this, in Maine -- and Maine knows, because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place."
16093,,1,"A great governor, great governor."
16094,,1,Paul is doing a great job.
16095,,1,And I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism.
16096,,1,"And we have a president that refuses to use the term, and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it."
16097,,1,"Now, she's being forced to use it by me."
16098,,1,"Did you notice she gave a speech, she said, I will use it."
16099,,1,"She called it, I think, radical Islam."
16100,,1,"But she said, I will use it."
16101,,1,I will.
16102,,1,Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
16103,,1,She called it the gold standard.
16104,,1,It is a horror show.
16105,,1,"It's almost as bad or maybe it's going to worse than NAFTA, signed by her husband, which cleaned out many of the states in our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing."
16106,,1,Moved to Mexico and other places.
16107,,1,"NAFTA, a total disaster."
16108,,1,"NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton."
16109,,1,"He never suffered the ravages, because he signed it, then he got out and other people did suffer with it.But we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, and if they don't want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back, at least a lot of them, if we can't make a great deal -- and she can't do that, by the way, if she wanted to."
16110,,1,"Number one, her donors would not let her."
16111,,1,Her special interests would never let her.
16112,,1,"Her lobbyists would never let her.Number three, she could not do it anyway."
16113,,1,Even if she wanted to.But we're going to renegotiate.
16114,,1,And did you hear her the other day?
16115,,1,"After years of saying how wonderful it is, even though you look at New England, and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio, if you look at a lot of other places, one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well, one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight, OK?"
16116,,1,Bobby Knight in Indiana.
16117,,1,That's gold standard right?
16118,,1,As she said about TPP.
16119,,1,"But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana, and they let go of 1,400 people."
16120,,1,"And I've been talking about this, and I know how to stop it, and you've heard me before, so easy to stop."
16121,,1,There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies.
16122,,1,"And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China, even though we make better product."
16123,,1,I have friends who are manufacturers.
16124,,1,We make better product.
16125,,1,"They can't get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can, they have to pay an incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs."
16126,,1,"But yet, we open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and we lose our jobs and it is very, very said."
16127,,1,"But look, as many know, a major destination -- Maine, has become a major destination for Somali refugees."
16128,,1,We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world.
16129,,1,"And you are getting them here too folks, you just don't know it because you just don't know."
16130,,1,Anybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory?
16131,,1,"All right, a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five, six, seven fold."
16132,,1,I don't get it.
16133,,1,"I mean, I know they will vote Democrat, OK, that's what I know, but they will not be voting for a long time."
16134,,1,"I just -- I don't get it, how can anybody even think this way?"
16135,,1,"Now, the Washington Times reported, ""of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net"" -- tremendous problems for safety -- ""and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groupsAren't we smart?"
16136,,1,We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs.
16137,,1,"Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples, and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently."
16138,,1,"The Boston bombers -- remember those horrible, disgusting people?"
16139,,1,"The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.
The younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012.
The older brother had a pending application for citizenship."
16140,,1,"And look what happened, we took them in."
16141,,1,"Look what happened, aren't we smart?"
16142,,1,The Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse.
16143,,1,Great.
16144,,1,A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs.
16145,,1,We let him in.
16146,,1,"An immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers, execution style if possible -- more than that, if at all possible."
16147,,1,"A college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S. citizenship, attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon."
16148,,1,"An immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship, and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible."
16149,,1,"An Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS, his travels to Syria, and how many Americans he wanted to kill."
16150,,1,"Two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb, in the middle of New York City."
16151,,1,An immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS.
16152,,1,He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.
16153,,1,All right folks.
16154,,1,"So, I just say, what are we doing?"
16155,,1,What are we doing?
16156,,1,And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in.
16157,,1,"You can almost say, you know, politics aside, whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a liberal, a Republican, a conservative; what are they doing?"
16158,,1,"I don't care who you are, what the hell are they doing?"
16159,,1,"So we are going to have strong borders, our southern border is going to be very powerful."
16160,,1,We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else.
16161,,1,The heroin epidemic is beyond belief.
16162,,1,"In New Hampshire, a great place, that is where I realized the extent of what is going on."
16163,,1,"I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me, ""the biggest problem they have is heroin."""
16164,,1,"I said, ""it can't be with the beautiful lakes and streams, it so beautiful."""
16165,,1,"Right, and their biggest problems heroin."
16166,,1,"I said, ""you have to be kidding, that can't be right, "" and it was."
16167,,1,Their youth is being poisoned.
16168,,1,"And then you go to Massachusetts, and you go to North Carolina, and South Carolina, and you come here, you come here -- I just left Iowa, you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border."
16169,,1,"And look, here's the story, we are going to have strong borders."
16170,,1,"We are going to have a wall, it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall."
16171,,1,You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago?
16172,,1,She wanted a wall.
16173,,1,"And the primary research, as we understand it, looking back, not that long ago, she wanted a wall."
16174,,1,"You know, walls do work folks, all you have to do is ask Israel."
16175,,1,All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.
16176,,1,"You know, it's sort of interesting, Obama talks about, ""there will be no wall."""
16177,,1,"But in the White House, which he just said, which is true, they want to build essentially a wall, they want to build a fence a lot bigger, and a lot higher, and a lot stronger."
16178,,1,"You know, it is interesting."
16179,,1,"I say, ""don't build that fence right, don't build that fence,"" because they say, ""walls don't work"" -- fences don't work, don't build that fence."""
16180,,1,"When Hillary doesn't want to let you have your guns, she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth, and I think she doesn't want to have guns."
16181,,1,I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons.
16182,,1,"OK, I mean it."
16183,,1,They should immediately give up their weapons.
16184,,1,"They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun, you just try to talk them out of it, I guess."
16185,,1,You got to do some quick talking.
16186,,1,"You got to do some quick talking, Hillary."
16187,,1,"I don't think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits, I don't think Hillary could get away with that one."
16188,,1,So we are going to have a little contrast.
16189,,1,"And I did this very quickly but it is so simple, Hillary wants to raise taxes, Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially, the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person."
16190,,1,Hillary wants to significantly expand regulations.
16191,,1,"Trump is going to get rid of many, many, many regulations."
16192,,1,"Which, by the way, are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding, from expanding and more than anything, from starting."
16193,,1,You can't start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.
16194,,1,Hillary wants to shut down energy production.
16195,,1,Trump wants to expand it significantly.
16196,,1,And we'll start paying off our debt.
16197,,1,"Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment, take away your right."
16198,,1,Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served.
16199,,1,Crooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas.
16200,,1,Who will destroy our Constitution.
16201,,1,I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution.
16202,,1,"As close, by the way, to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get, OK?"
16203,,1,"Hillary wants to open our borders, just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way."
16204,,1,"There are reasons, I understand that."
16205,,1,I want to totally secure our borders.
16206,,1,But I want people to come in.
16207,,1,But they come in through a process and they come in legally.
16208,,1,Hillary wants to invade foreign countries.
16209,,1,"You ever see the one where she says ""Donald Trump with the nuclear"" -- I'm -- I didn't want the war in Iraq."
16210,,1,And I'm on record.
16211,,1,I didn't want the war in Iraq.
16212,,1,I didn't want all of -- what they've done.
16213,,1,"And I said, if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago, you'll see everything I said was exactly right."
16214,,1,It's going to de-stabilize the Middle East.
16215,,1,"I said the meanest, toughest group of people, the people that hate the United States and its people the most, they're going to take it over."
16216,,1,That's exactly what's happening.
16217,,1,"They're taking over the oil, they're taking over the land, they're taking over everything."
16218,,1,"I didn't want it, but I'm always being accused like the war hog they think I'm a tough guy, the war hog."
16219,,1,Right?
16220,,1,They think she wants to be tough with Russia.
16221,,1,"So she said well, Donald Trump likes Putin."
16222,,1,"I don't know Putin, folks."
16223,,1,I don't know.
16224,,1,"I hope I like him, I hope he likes me because I'd love to get along with Russia."
16225,,1,OK?
16226,,1,Love to.
16227,,1,But I don't know.
16228,,1,"But she goes Donald Trump, Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things, she said right?"
16229,,1,And I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that?
16230,,1,That's good.
16231,,1,"But she's going to be the tough one, see?"
16232,,1,She's going to be the tough one.
16233,,1,"She's going to play with nuclear weapons, you know?"
16234,,1,"They have all the nukes, nice nukes."
16235,,1,She's going to be the tough one.
16236,,1,"I'll tell you what, you put her in the office of the president -- you know, she hates Putin and Putin hates her, right?"
16237,,1,That's what I hear.
16238,,1,"No, no -- Putin probably doesn't respect her more than anything else."
16239,,1,But Putin hates her.
16240,,1,But she's going to be tough.
16241,,1,"We're going to be tough with Russia -- oh, we're going to be tough, right?"
16242,,1,"Let me tell you, we're in a different world today, folks."
16243,,1,We're in a different world.
16244,,1,But she makes it sound like I'm this tough guy that will have a temperament.
16245,,1,"You know, she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word?"
16246,,1,"Her people that write the speeches, we'll say Trump with a temperament."
16247,,1,They said Trump in a speech with tweets.
16248,,1,"I've got -- I've got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21, 22 million people."
16249,,1,"It's an asset, it's an asset."
16250,,1,I tweet well.
16251,,1,"But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech, you know, I heard it barely because I was falling asleep, you couldn't watch it."
16252,,1,All right.
16253,,1,So remember that one.
16254,,1,Hillary wants to invade foreign countries.
16255,,1,Look at Libya.
16256,,1,Look at that.
16257,,1,We did a great job there.
16258,,1,"You know, a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe, but I mean even that, what the hell do we get out of this?"
16259,,1,It's a disaster.
16260,,1,"Then you have Benghazi, then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil, large portions of the oil."
16261,,1,And it's some of the finest oil in the world.
16262,,1,And you have ISIS grabbing it.We don't know what we're doing.
16263,,1,We have people that don't know what we're doing.
16264,,1,"We have people that militarily -- in fact, they said well, who is your military consultants?"
16265,,1,And I give them names.
16266,,1,"But they're not working now, you know they're not working now."
16267,,1,"And I said of course they're not working now, look what working now people have gotten us."
16268,,1,"Havoc, who the hell wants the people who are working now?"
16269,,1,"I mean   You know, a lot of it's common sense and a lot of it's instinct and she has very bad judgment, she's got no instinct whatsoever."
16270,,1,"And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO, they said what do you think of NATO?"
16271,,1,"Now, you know it's not like it was my primary subject in all fairness."
16272,,1,I've only been doing this for 12 months.
16273,,1,"Now, it's actually almost 14 months, hard to believe, right?"
16274,,1,But NATO -- so I said I know enough.
16275,,1,And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much.
16276,,1,"You understand, you can't see the forest through the trees, right?"
16277,,1,So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism.
16278,,1,"Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying what they're supposed to be paying."
16279,,1,And we're protecting those guys and we're supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that aren't paying their fair share.
16280,,1,And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did.
16281,,1,"He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right, we have cut you see that's right did you see the letter -- the big story?"
16282,,1,Donald Trump is right.
16283,,1,I'm sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that.
16284,,1,Donald Trump is right; you have countries that aren't paying.
16285,,1,And he said how he goes in and he talks to them.
16286,,1,"He says look, you've got to pay your bills."
16287,,1,I have budgets -- which is true.
16288,,1,And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say what's happening.
16289,,1,They don't pay their bills though because people don't ask properly.
16290,,1,And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country.
16291,,1,"Sir, we owe the United States millions of dollars.
We're ready to pay."
16292,,1,"Oh, have they asked for the money?"
16293,,1,No.
16294,,1,"They'll pay, OKBut I will say the commander of NATO said I was right."
16295,,1,And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here.
16296,,1,They said Donald Trump -- now they're the worst.
16297,,1,They're the worst.
16298,,1,They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesn't like NATO.
16299,,1,He is going to abandon NATO.
16300,,1,That's not what I said.
16301,,1,I said they've got to pay.
16302,,1,They've got to pay.
16303,,1,"Now, you have to walk."
16304,,1,You may have to walk.
16305,,1,But they've got to pay.
16306,,1,"We're going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States, right?"
16307,,1,"No, they've got to pay."
16308,,1,"And they probably will, in all fairness."
16309,,1,"But Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan, we're defending Japan you know that, right?"
16310,,1,"Now, in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago."
16311,,1,Did anybody know that we defend Japan?
16312,,1,Raise your hand who knew.
16313,,1,"All right, there's about 12 percent."
16314,,1,Not bad.
16315,,1,"I think some of you are lying, OK?"
16316,,1,I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
16317,,1,I think some of you are lying.
16318,,1,"But we defend Japan and a man comes up, general or something, a few months ago, I remember so vividly."
16319,,1,And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying they've got to pay their way.
16320,,1,"And if they don't -- if they don't, you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that."
16321,,1,"You know, we don't want to do that, I understand the reason."
16322,,1,It'd be nice to have them but you know this isn't again 40 years ago.
16323,,1,We owe $20 trillion.
16324,,1,We're defending all these -- we defend Japan.
16325,,1,We defend Germany.
16326,,1,We defend Saudi Arabia.
16327,,1,You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them?
16328,,1,No.
16329,,1,"No, think of it."
16330,,1,"Think of it, think of the stupidity."
16331,,1,Think of the stupidity.
16332,,1,"So this general comes up, has a news conference a few months ago."
16333,,1,"And he said, ""Mr. Trump doesn't understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them."""
16334,,1,"So a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me, ""Mr. Trump, we'd like your comment."
16335,,1,"They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend."""
16336,,1,And I said why aren't they paying 100 percent?
16337,,1,"The reporter said, OK."" Not a bad question."
16338,,1,"Now, here's the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton."
16339,,1,Here's the problem.
16340,,1,"Here is -- that's why she changed her last -- that's why she doesn't want to use the name anymore, because everybody was saying that."
16341,,1,I don't know.
16342,,1,I've been saying it.
16343,,1,"But look, here is -- here is why it doesn't work for Hillary."
16344,,1,"She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs, at least, right?Japan, economic behemoth."
16345,,1,Germany -- see how well they're doing -- economic behemoth.
16346,,1,"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.They were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices, now they're making a fortune, the same thing."
16347,,1,Economic behemoth.
16348,,1,"Why are defending them, and why aren't we being fully reimbursed?"
16349,,1,"Now, if we do that, your budget already is starting to look real good, OK. You know, you have budgets, so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit, folks.We trade with companies."
16350,,1,"We have a deficit with other countries, think of it -- $800 billion a year."
16351,,1,Trade deficit.
16352,,1,Do we make the deals?
16353,,1,"no.With China, $505 billion trade deficit."
16354,,1,And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time.
16355,,1,"Whenever it gets a little bit tough, devalue, devalue, and our companies can't compete with that."
16356,,1,Right?
16357,,1,"So, here's the thing."
16358,,1,"So, Hillary says about Japan, how dare he not not stay with our allies, how dare he not do that?I will never abandon our allies, ever, ever, ever."
16359,,1,"Now, how do you negotiate when you're telling somebody will never going to leave?"
16360,,1,We may have to leave.
16361,,1,"Look, Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles."
16362,,1,"But I mean, you know, so we'll get it.Now, South Korea, it is an economic behemoth."
16363,,1,"You can't buy television that is not made in South Korea, except Sony, which is made in Japan, which has sort of lost its way."
16364,,1,Whether it is LG or Samsung.
16365,,1,I order thousands of television sets; you can't buy them in the United States.
16366,,1,I'd love to.
16367,,1,Show me one company.
16368,,1,"One of the pundits said, they do make them."
16369,,1,There's a company.
16370,,1,"And he showed me, it's a little company."
16371,,1,"What they do is, all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together, and they give you a television that doesn't work and nobody ever heard of it."
16372,,1,"And then I put it into a luxury hotel, and everybody complains, right?So, you can't say to people when you're negotiating -- because we're talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars."
16373,,1,"You can't say to people -- you can't say to people when you're negotiating, we'll never leave you."
16374,,1,"Think of this, we're going to never leave you; we love you, we'll never leave you."
16375,,1,Could you pay more?
16376,,1,"No, we're not going to pay anymore."
16377,,1,You're not going to leave us.
16378,,1,Why should we pay more?
16379,,1,"So, there's a chance we'll have to leave."
16380,,1,"And there's a chance that, you know, Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out."
16381,,1,We're very far away.
16382,,1,It's very expensive.
16383,,1,"You know, we have a treaty with Japan."
16384,,1,"And if the United States is attacked, they don't have to do anything."
16385,,1,"But if Japan is attacked, we have to go in there will our full force and might, and who the hell knows what's going to happen, rightWorld War III, who knows what's going to happen."
16386,,1,"But if we're attacked, they don't have to do anything."
16387,,1,"You tell me, who makes these deals?It's like Sergeant Bergdahl, right?"
16388,,1,"So, we trade a dirty, rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted, and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor."
16389,,1,"We trade for five of the greatest killers, the greatest killers in the Middle East, the five people that they wanted the most."
16390,,1,That is our deal.
16391,,1,"So, we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now, most of them, already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody, including us."
16392,,1,"No more, folks."
16393,,1,That is called the five for one president.
16394,,1,That's -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million.
16395,,1,"The other guys couldn't leave the airport, the hostages."
16396,,1,"And then all of a sudden, they were able to leave."
16397,,1,"And then you watched him yesterday saying that, can you believe it?"
16398,,1,This had nothing to do with that.
16399,,1,OK?
16400,,1,Just a coincidence.
16401,,1,"No, no, just a coincidence -- no."
16402,,1,"You know, she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons."
16403,,1,He is unfit also.
16404,,1,He has done so bad.
16405,,1,He has been so incompetent.
16406,,1,We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it.
16407,,1,"Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country, he gets in, and in eight years by the time his term is up, we will have doubled our national debt."
16408,,1,Think of it.
16409,,1,"So, we have to win this election."
16410,,1,This is a very important election.
16411,,1,"I do not need to do this, folks, believe me."
16412,,1,"I could be elsewhere right now, I love being with you."
16413,,1,But I could be elsewhere.
16414,,1,"I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin, just a different location."
16415,,1,OK?
16416,,1,But I felt I had to do it.
16417,,1,I want to give back.
16418,,1,"I will get back give back, I'm going to give back."
16419,,1,I'm going to give back.
16420,,1,I want to give back.
16421,,1,Because our country does not win anymore.Our country does not win anymore.
16422,,1,And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton.
16423,,1,Not going to win.
16424,,1,It's not going to win.
16425,,1,She does not know how to win.
16426,,1,Our country is not going to win with her.
16427,,1,We're going to be worse than we are with Obama.
16428,,1,"I mean, if you want four more years of what is going on, ISIS, all over the place, ISIS expanding.And by the way, our policeman are great, great people."
16429,,1,And we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore.
16430,,1,Anymore.
16431,,1,No more.
16432,,1,"No more.So, November 8th, you have a big election."
16433,,1,"I promise you this, if I win, we're going to start winning again."
16434,,1,"We are going to win on trade, we're going to win with our military, we're going to take out ISIS, we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated."
16435,,1,Our veterans are great.
16436,,1,We have a great plan for the veterans.
16437,,1,"We're are going to win for our veterans, first time, maybe ever.We are going to win on trade deals."
16438,,1,"We are going to make the finest, we are going to bring our jobs back."
16439,,1,We're not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody.
16440,,1,"It going to be very, very expensive when they do it."
16441,,1,"Believe me, it's going to be very, very expensive."
16442,,1,"They're going to say, you know what?"
16443,,1,"Maybe we'll stay Wisconsin, OK?"
16444,,1,Maybe we will stay.
16445,,1,"No, it's going to be very, very hard."
16446,,1,"We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall."
16447,,1,"Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent."
16448,,1,We are going to get rid of Obamacare.
16449,,1,"We're going to get rid of Common Core, we're going to bring our education -- local."
16450,,1,We're going to have local education.
16451,,1,We're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices.
16452,,1,"And folks, we're going to start winning again."
16453,,1,We're going to win at every level.
16454,,1,"We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning, I'm telling you."
16455,,1,"You're going to be begging me, Mr. President -- you will send your great quarterback, right?"
16456,,1,He will come to the White House.
16457,,1,Everybody respects him.
16458,,1,"He'll come to the White House, and he'll say, Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin, they can't stand winning so much."
16459,,1,Could you tone it down just a little bit?
16460,,1,"I will say, I just can't do that."
16461,,1,"We are going to win more, and more and more, we're going to win at every level."
16462,,1,But we are going to win.
16463,,1,We are going to make America great again.
16464,,1,"We're going to make America safe again.Thank you very much, everybody."
16465,,1,Thank you.
16466,,1,Thank you.
16467,,1,Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.
16468,,1,It's wonderful to be in Detroit.
16469,,1,We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.
16470,,1,"It's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story BeginsDetroit was once the economic envy of the world."
16471,,1,"The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming."
16472,,1,"Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own."
16473,,1,"The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit."
16474,,1,"Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average."
16475,,1,"40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average."
16476,,1,The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
16477,,1,"Half of all Detroit residents do not work.Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda."
16478,,1,"Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.She is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.Today, I will outline my economic vision."
16479,,1,"In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas."
16480,,1,"All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same  more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States."
16481,,1,"Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.That's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.First, let's talk tax reform.Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.Hillary Clinton who has spent her career voting for tax increases plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase."
16482,,1,"Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again to use a now famous term when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans."
16483,,1,"This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process."
16484,,1,"We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed  12, 25 and 33 percent."
16485,,1,"For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles  jobs, growth and opportunity.These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.We will Make America Grow Again.In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family."
16486,,1,"It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership."
16487,,1,The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises.
16488,,1,"She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator."
16489,,1,But what happened?
16490,,1,"The Washington Post writes, and I quote  ""upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term."
16491,,1,"Compare that to my record.
In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,"" the paper writes that I and this is a direct quote ""waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will   [he] rode to the rescue."
16492,,1,"Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead."
16493,,1,"This is what I want to do for our country I want to jumpstart America.Now let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.
It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.
Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.
These are the real unemployment numbers the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.
On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.
It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.In other words, we punish companies for making products in America but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.This is backwards.
All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.
Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan.
Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.
I am going to cut regulations massively.Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country and into cities like Detroit.
To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.
Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.
This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax.
American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death it's just plain wrong.
We will repeal it.Next comes regulatory reformAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation  I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country.
The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year that's money taken straight out of cities like yours.The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long.
As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.
My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana.
This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.
Those regulations will be eliminated.We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.
When I am president, we will.One of the most important reforms of all is trade reformAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.
We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.
We've seen it in Iran.
We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.But we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit.Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Let's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion resulting in some 70,000 jobs.Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false.
Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning  if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP.
Guaranteed.
Her donors will make sure of it.A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP and it's also a vote for NAFTA.Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.
Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.
Today, that number is only 160,000.Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology.
I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.Hillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.
In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.
That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.
Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP.
She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.
It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.
If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.
This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.
They break the rules in every way imaginable.
China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.
They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.
According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.
But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.
Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reformThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions.
The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.
Hillary Clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business."
16494,,1,"We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;Increase totaleconomic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginningWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.
I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.
Without security, there can be no prosperity.
We must have law and order.In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.
One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.
This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.Detroit the Motor City will come roaring back.
We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.There will be no change under Hillary Clinton only four more years of Obama.But we are going to look boldly into the future.We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy mined from American sources that powers this country.It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.Our country will reach amazing new heights.All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.They want you to think small.
I am asking you to think big.We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.We are ready to show the world that America is Back Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.Thank you, and God Bless You.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[ ] Thank you very much.
So amazing.
Rudy just left.
He just said, I don't believe this."
16495,,1,"This is unbelievable."""
16496,,1,Nobody believes it.
16497,,1,"The crowds we're getting -- I'm the messenger, but I'll tell you what, the message is the right message."
16498,,1,We're tired of incompetence.
16499,,1,We're tired of not taking care of our military.
16500,,1,"We're tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.We're tired of so many different things."
16501,,1,And this is what happens.
16502,,1,"So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I'm telling you, he said, ""I don't believe this."
16503,,1,This is incredible.
16504,,1,"And what he hasn't seen, and your governor, by the way, who's a great guy.And he's now seeing it, they're walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can't get in.
I said, Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside."
16505,,1,"So I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here.
And we are going to have a good time.
We love North Carolina.
We love North Carolina  We did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now.
We have to win.
That November 8 day is so important.You know, I bring things up like the judges right?
Supreme Court Justices, we have to get - you know, you could have as many as four?
I guess it's a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.And if you pick two that are left, left, left, it's going to be a disaster for our country.
Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago.
And they're great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people.
But if you - if you do something with these - I'll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia.
We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that's going to happen.
It is so important.So if for no other reason, I mean it's such an important - it's one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons.
But that's so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency.
This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do.
Believe me, I'll make you very proud of those Justices everyday.
So we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash, right -- $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like?
That's a lot of cash.
That's a lot of case.And honestly, it's so sad.
Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state.
Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we've given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.Now, a lot of people say, no, no, it's used for terror,"" and they use it for terror because it's the number one terror funder - not even close."
16506,,1,"But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this?"
16507,,1,I guess they did release the pictures after all.
16508,,1,"They released pictures.And interesting I'll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right?"
16509,,1,"You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that."
16510,,1,You can do a lot of things.And Obama said that he did it because we don't have a working account with Iran.
16511,,1,Do you believe that?
16512,,1,How long does it take to set up an account?
16513,,1,Right?
16514,,1,"You don't have a working account, you set up an account, right?You set up an account and it takes about - look, what's going on in this country - folks, folks, what's going on in this country is insane."
16515,,1,"And we have people running our country that don't know what they're doing, they're grossly incompetent, and it's time."
16516,,1,"We have to make change, real change."
16517,,1,"Not Obama change, we have to make change.Whether it's Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for eight years."
16518,,1,We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade.
16519,,1,"For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.They get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they'll get way, way earlier than that."
16520,,1,"They'll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you're going to see a lot of changes to that deal."
16521,,1,That'll happen fast.
16522,,1,"You're going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right?"
16523,,1,"It really doesn't work, does it?"
16524,,1,Does it?
16525,,1,"I mean, remember Obamacare, ""you're going to keep your doctor, you're going to keep your plan, over and over again, you're going to keep your doctor."""
16526,,1,"It was a lie.And in fact, if he didn't make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn't want to do it."
16527,,1,"It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it."
16528,,1,"And it was a lie.And the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn't leave the airport until this other plane arrived."
16529,,1,"They don't know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why."
16530,,1,"It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie.And it's so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse."
16531,,1,Maybe worse.
16532,,1,There'll be four more years.
16533,,1,"Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes."
16534,,1,"You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event, really."
16535,,1,"It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit  Good event, very good."
16536,,1,And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments.
16537,,1,"But the thing I'm doing, I'm cutting taxes big league."
16538,,1,Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses.
16539,,1,"Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period."
16540,,1,Businesses are leaving our country like they've never left before.
16541,,1,They're going all over.
16542,,1,"They're going to Mexico, that I can tell you."
16543,,1,Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world.
16544,,1,"You know I've been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy."
16545,,1,"He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them."
16546,,1,Massive plants.
16547,,1,"And I said to him, how are you doing?And he's worked in North Carolina, by the way."
16548,,1,"I said to him, how are you doing?"
16549,,1,He said phenomenal.
16550,,1,"He's like, ""I think the biggest in the world at this -"" that's what he does."
16551,,1,Great guy.
16552,,1,I said how's it all going?
16553,,1,"He said, 'you've got to see Mexico, Donald."
16554,,1,It's the eighth wonder of the world.
16555,,1,"What we're building there is like, never has been built."
16556,,1,"We've never seen anything like it""."
16557,,1,"And I said, how are we doing in the United States?"
16558,,1,"I'm more interested in that, OK?"
16559,,1,It's OK I guess.
16560,,1,Right?
16561,,1,"You know, America first, folks."
16562,,1,America first.
16563,,1,America.
16564,,1,"Right, America first."
16565,,1,America first.
16566,,1,"We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen."
16567,,1,It's just not that they want other countries to benefit over us.
16568,,1,"There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I'm putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I'm funding me."
16569,,1,And I'm raising for the Republican party.
16570,,1,And we're getting a lot of money from the small donors.Remember two months ago?
16571,,1,"Well, I hadn't started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?Let me get the nomination, please."
16572,,1,"And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world's most dishonest people, by the way."
16573,,1,Terrible.
16574,,1,Terrible.
16575,,1,Those cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium.
16576,,1,"Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota?"
16577,,1,Any protesters?
16578,,1,"If we had a protester that's the only time they move because they're showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move."
16579,,1,"But I like that, I've always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd."
16580,,1,"You know, I go home to my wife, I say how's it going?"
16581,,1,"She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there?"
16582,,1,"I say yeah, about 7,000."
16583,,1,That's a small group.
16584,,1,Its only confined -- I mean you had to see outside.
16585,,1,I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too.
16586,,1,Who said that?
16587,,1,"Who said that, huh?"
16588,,1,"Thank you, thank you."
16589,,1,But I came up with Rudy from New York and we're driving up and we're going block after block after block the line.
16590,,1,And I said are those people going to be able to get in?They said the place is already full.
16591,,1,And Rudy just said man; I've never seen anything like that.
16592,,1,"Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what's happening."
16593,,1,"Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks."
16594,,1,Because people are so tired of them.
16595,,1,They're so tired of them.
16596,,1,"So -- and by the way -- and by the way, voter ID, watch with that."
16597,,1,"Watch with voter ID, why aren't we having voter ID?"
16598,,1,"In other words, I wanna vote, here's my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary."
16599,,1,Well -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times.
16600,,1,"I will not tell you to do that, OK?"
16601,,1,You won't vote 15 times.
16602,,1,"But people will, they'll vote many times and how that could've happened , it's unbelievable."
16603,,1,And the governor just told me that they're going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay.
16604,,1,"Let's see what happens, OK?"
16605,,1,Let's see what happens.
16606,,1,That's a very important thing.
16607,,1,"But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important -- yes, darling thank you."
16608,,1,"Unstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right?"
16609,,1,"And nobody said anything about it, no problem."
16610,,1,He said you lack judgment.
16611,,1,"And -- during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine."
16612,,1,When I say it they say that's terrible the way you talk.
16613,,1,"She does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I'm the one that used unfit many, many months ago."
16614,,1,"And now they've turned it around, use it on me, unfit?"
16615,,1,I'm unfit?
16616,,1,That's -- that's a first.
16617,,1,"But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple."
16618,,1,She really does.
16619,,1,"She's a dangerous person who doesn't tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.I've never seen a -- I don't think we've ever had greater proof of that, of anybody."
16620,,1,And she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see what's happening -- with what she has done with her server?
16621,,1,"And you know why she did that.So, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within."
16622,,1,Remember that.
16623,,1,Remember that.
16624,,1,"She will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks."
16625,,1,You look at what's going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France.
16626,,1,I have friends that go to France.
16627,,1,They used to love France.
16628,,1,"They say, no thank you."
16629,,1,"They don't expect to be going back anytime for a long time.I have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France?"
16630,,1,"He said, France isn't France anymore."
16631,,1,We're not going.
16632,,1,And so many people are saying that.
16633,,1,Look at what's going on with Germany.
16634,,1,Look at what's happening with Germany.
16635,,1,Look at the crime; look at the problems.
16636,,1,We have enough problems in our country right now.
16637,,1,"We don't need additional problems, folks."
16638,,1,We don't need additional problems.
16639,,1,"And for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse."
16640,,1,This could be.
16641,,1,"We don't know who these people are.Now, they're coming in through Obama."
16642,,1,"And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it's like for years, it's sort of like this, a little uptick."
16643,,1,"And the last number or period of time, it's like, ""Wah, wah, wah, wah."""
16644,,1,There -- I have never seen anything like it.
16645,,1,"They're letting them in, and again, you can't vet them."
16646,,1,You don't know where they come from.
16647,,1,"We don't know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in."
16648,,1,Look at the damage in Orlando.
16649,,1,"Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job."
16650,,1,And you know what he was screaming?
16651,,1,He's screaming what they all scream.
16652,,1,"And we have to get smart, folks."
16653,,1,"We don't need the problems -- and we've already got those problems, just so you understand."
16654,,1,"Because they're coming into the country, they're being put where nobody even knows where they are."
16655,,1,"It's like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can't believe they're that stupid."
16656,,1,"They're taking my people and they're putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here."
16657,,1,And our military  Our military cannot be beaten.
16658,,1,But you know what could happen?
16659,,1,"When we don't know where they are, where they're coming, you've them all over the place."
16660,,1,"And folks, it's some."
16661,,1,You don't need many; you don't need many.
16662,,1,One person in Orlando.
16663,,1,"Two people -- look at in France, 130."
16664,,1,"Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris."
16665,,1,"One hundred and thirty people killed, 130."
16666,,1,"And I've said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks."
16667,,1,Would have been a whole different.
16668,,1,"For those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different -- and I'd go a step further."
16669,,1,"If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people."
16670,,1,"If these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn't have gone in in the first place, all right?"
16671,,1,All right?
16672,,1,Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?Do you know what a gun-free zone is?
16673,,1,"That's like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story."
16674,,1,Maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place.
16675,,1,So they better not come here.
16676,,1,They better not.
16677,,1,They better not.
16678,,1,So recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago.
16679,,1,A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited.
16680,,1,"Hey, could you imagine if I said that ""I short circuited""?"
16681,,1,"They would be calling for my execution, -- electric chair."
16682,,1,They'd bring back the electric chair.
16683,,1,"It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me."
16684,,1,"But the Secret Service agent said, ""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,"" right?"
16685,,1,"From the bottom of my soul, he said, ""I know this to be true."
16686,,1,"Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions."
16687,,1,OK?
16688,,1,"Hey, you know, it's one thing to make bad decisions."
16689,,1,It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions.
16690,,1,She is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn't changed a bit.
16691,,1,This is -- that was the good thing.
16692,,1,I couldn't say the bad things.
16693,,1,It was too much.
16694,,1,Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it.
16695,,1,You've got to see this book.
16696,,1,"Nobody would believe because it's so terrible, so terrible."
16697,,1,"And she comes across like this woman -- nice, easy -- but she's not."
16698,,1,"And -- and she's -- listen -- she's not a leader, not a leader."
16699,,1,And she is a liar.
16700,,1,"Hey, hey -- 33,000 e-mails are gone."
16701,,1,OK?
16702,,1,"33,000 e-mails are gone."
16703,,1,They're gone.
16704,,1,"How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails?"
16705,,1,"Who sends 33,000 e-mails?"
16706,,1,"I mean, 33 -- do you know how many that is?"
16707,,1,"I think that's like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn't matter."
16708,,1,"For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing."
16709,,1,And she's so guilty.
16710,,1,She's so guilty.
16711,,1,I think it's a tremendous blot in our country.
16712,,1,I really mean that.
16713,,1,"I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences."
16714,,1,"I think it's a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot."
16715,,1,Just remember that.
16716,,1,"But I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera."
16717,,1,"Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression."
16718,,1,"Now, this is, like, unbelievable -- 1.2."
16719,,1,"Do you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it's like a national catastrophe."
16720,,1,"Now, what they do is they cut their currency.They devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States."
16721,,1,"Our money, our jobs."
16722,,1,"They make our product, they sell our product to us."
16723,,1,"No tax, no nothing, you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating."
16724,,1,"You know, it's sort of like cheating."
16725,,1,Now I have great relationships with China.
16726,,1,"I've done great business with China, I've done really well with China."
16727,,1,"I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma'am."
16728,,1,Got to win -- got to win North Carolina.
16729,,1,Thank you.
16730,,1,Thank you.
16731,,1,"But they -- it's cheating, it's really cheating."
16732,,1,"And when I look at these trade deals -- it's so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone, it's $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion."
16733,,1,"This is year in and year out, it's actually amazing that our country keeps going."
16734,,1,"But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18."
16735,,1,"And in many cases, they're working two and three jobs, OK?"
16736,,1,But they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago.
16737,,1,"And those stats come right out, real wages."
16738,,1,"They're working harder, they're getting older."
16739,,1,"So in theory it's supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you're young, you don't care."
16740,,1,"Get a little older, it's like, oh by the way, how about me?"
16741,,1,"I think I'm working harder too, if you want to know."
16742,,1,I never worked this hard in my life.
16743,,1,"But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I've met so many incredible people."
16744,,1,You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country.
16745,,1,"Because I'm going to places that I've heard about, I've known about, I'm stopping everywhere."
16746,,1,"And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage."
16747,,1,It's been horrible.
16748,,1,"I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state."
16749,,1,You look at New England.
16750,,1,New England got really whacked.
16751,,1,New England got hit.
16752,,1,"You look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening."
16753,,1,"By the way, this isn't like it's going to happen or it's all over, it's getting worse."
16754,,1,"You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what's going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable."
16755,,1,"And more and more, you know they're moving."
16756,,1,We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday.
16757,,1,"Where they've lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it's really not the car capital anymore."
16758,,1,Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time.
16759,,1,"No, think of it."
16760,,1,And that's only because we allow it to happen.
16761,,1,And I like Mexico.
16762,,1,"And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they're much smarter, they're much street smarter, but they're much smarter and more cunning than our leaders."
16763,,1,But you have to see what's going on.
16764,,1,"And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he's the best, he's the greatest."
16765,,1,"But one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they're building a plant in Mexico."
16766,,1,And we're not going to let it happen .
16767,,1,.
16768,,1,.It's a suicidal pact for our country.
16769,,1,And you know I've watched for years.I was never a politician until 14 months ago.
16770,,1,So I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician.
16771,,1,Can't believe it.
16772,,1,But -- but I've been watching for years and I've watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries.
16773,,1,"And I've seen low interest loans, I've seen zero interest loans, I've seen all sorts of subsidies."
16774,,1,I get it.
16775,,1,"That stuff's not gonna work, that's not gonna work."
16776,,1,"What's gonna work is -- as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant."
16777,,1,"I hope my friend bills it, right?"
16778,,1,And then you know what happens?
16779,,1,"When they make their air conditioners -- and then think they're gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price."
16780,,1,And they think they're gonna sell it there and have no repercussions?
16781,,1,"With me, they have repercussions, OK?"
16782,,1,"With me, they have repercussions."
16783,,1,"With me, we inform them that if you move, you're gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders."
16784,,1,"And two things are gonna happen, one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen."
16785,,1,"Number one, if you get them in time, they're not moving."
16786,,1,"Throws it all off-balance, since they're all off-kilter."
16787,,1,"Number one they're not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn't anybody use this?"
16788,,1,Why doesn't anybody mention it?
16789,,1,I'll tell you why.
16790,,1,"Because they're controlled by their lobbyists, they're politicians."
16791,,1,And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- I'm just using Carrier as an example.
16792,,1,Its hundreds and thousands.
16793,,1,Its thousands of company.
16794,,1,And millions of jobs we're talking about.
16795,,1,"I was looking at numbers -- I'm not gonna repeat the numbers because they'll say I was wrong, it can't be that high, I couldn't believe it was that high."
16796,,1,But it's thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.
16797,,1,"And you'd say why aren't -- like, why doesn't somebody else say what Trump is saying?"
16798,,1,"So I'm controlled by myself because I'm putting up my money, OK?"
16799,,1,I'm putting up my money.
16800,,1,"But  Although we raised, did you see $82 million last month, $82 million last month?"
16801,,1,And a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get.
16802,,1,"A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that?"
16803,,1,"The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn't raise any money."
16804,,1,"And they told you why, right?"
16805,,1,I didn't raise it because I didn't know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination.
16806,,1,"If I didn't get the nomination, I would've gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK?"
16807,,1,In Scotland.
16808,,1,But you know what?
16809,,1,I got the nomination so now I had a start.
16810,,1,"And we raised $51 million in June, right?"
16811,,1,A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July.
16812,,1,"People are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump -- they said, that's amazing."
16813,,1,So we're doing all right.
16814,,1,"And people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message."
16815,,1,Because this is a message this is an important message.
16816,,1,But when you say -- and when you hear what I just said -- you charge a tariff or a tax.
16817,,1,And guess what?
16818,,1,"And people said why hasn't the -- why haven't the politicians, they're smart, why haven't they done it?"
16819,,1,Because they're controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they're not gonna do it.
16820,,1,Whether it's donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen.
16821,,1,"And honestly, I think it's a total disgrace.I think it's a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country."
16822,,1,"If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye."
16823,,1,They were so quiet.
16824,,1,"You know, I like the Hillary protesters."
16825,,1,You know why?
16826,,1,They're so nice and quiet.
16827,,1,The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough.
16828,,1,Right?
16829,,1,The Hillary protesters had no spirit.
16830,,1,Did you see that?
16831,,1,"She starts screaming and the guy walks up, ""I'll go."""
16832,,1,The Bernie ones were -- they had a lot more spirit.
16833,,1,"I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth."
16834,,1,Because they do understand that trade is killing us.
16835,,1,Trade.
16836,,1,"So, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing."
16837,,1,"One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it."
16838,,1,That's not a recovery.
16839,,1,"It's probably much -- don't forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it's lower."
16840,,1,And 1.2 is starting to set records.
16841,,1,"The national debt -- so, we're up to almost $20 trillion -- $20 trillion!"
16842,,1,The national debt under Obama has doubled.
16843,,1,"Think of it, doubled."
16844,,1,"Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it's going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurateBecause I'll say -- they'll say, well, it hasn't quite doubled."
16845,,1,"Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.The national debt has doubled."
16846,,1,And you know the bad part about that?
16847,,1,"You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shapeWe'd have beautiful roads, beautiful highways."
16848,,1,You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country.
16849,,1,"And the roadways are a mess.I have a friend, he's in the trucking business."
16850,,1,"He said, you know, for years, he had no problem."
16851,,1,"Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had."
16852,,1,"So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you'd really think that we'd be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right?"
16853,,1,We're not.
16854,,1,We're in very bad shape.
16855,,1,"U.S. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion."
16856,,1,"Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?In the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force."
16857,,1,Think of it.
16858,,1,"These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.You know, you look for a job, you can't find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever."
16859,,1,"You gave up, and now you're considered -- statistically, you're considered employed."
16860,,1,Those people are not employed; these are great people.
16861,,1,"And there are plenty of them in here.I mean, we have great people."
16862,,1,We have the most loyal people.
16863,,1,We have the smartest people.
16864,,1,"You know, so many of my people, they're so smart.They like to say, well, Trump, I don't know if he's got this right -- let me tell you, we have the smartest people."
16865,,1,"We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working."
16866,,1,We have the smartest people.
16867,,1,"We'll put I.Q.s among -- some of us, we couldn't say all of us, right -- against any I.Q.s that we -- we have to deal with, ."
16868,,1,.
16869,,1,".In the last seven years, 14 million."
16870,,1,One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce.
16871,,1,"Pretty bad.Homeownership -- this is one that is amazing to me -- today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.So you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right?"
16872,,1,"The American home.Lowest that its been in so many years, 51 years."
16873,,1,Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton -- under Obama; because Clinton's just gonna carry on.
16874,,1,"You know, I don't know if you saw."
16875,,1,"I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we're gonna get rid of so many of them."
16876,,1,But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she's gonna double up your taxes.
16877,,1,"And she's trying to say well, I don't know like Trump's way -- she's gonna double up your taxes."
16878,,1,You're gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in.
16879,,1,"Enjoy -- enjoy it folks, if that happens."
16880,,1,Fifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed.
16881,,1,How sad is that?
16882,,1,"American households are earning $4,000 less -- listen to this one, today -- than they were 16 years ago."
16883,,1,Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars.
16884,,1,"So 1970 -- that's a long time ago, right?"
16885,,1,They're earning in real dollars less money.
16886,,1,"So under my plan, we're gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs."
16887,,1,"You know, it's interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they're bad jobs."
16888,,1,I've heard it from many of the people.
16889,,1,They're trying to defend him.
16890,,1,"But they say they're bad jobs, they're not good jobs."
16891,,1,The good jobs -- the good jobs have left.
16892,,1,But we'll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs.
16893,,1,"That's so important, that's so important."
16894,,1,Everyone's taxes will go down.
16895,,1,Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career.
16896,,1,"She's voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate."
16897,,1,That's all?
16898,,1,"I thought it was more than that, 235 times."
16899,,1,"I hope there's not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times."
16900,,1,"But I don't think there is -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate."
16901,,1,"Now, she's planning another job killing -- $1.3 trillion tax increase, that's what her tax increase is gonna be, folks."
16902,,1,"Like you're not paying enough, right?"
16903,,1,Her plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business.
16904,,1,"Then we have -- we will make -- and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK?"
16905,,1,"My daughter, so great."
16906,,1,So great.
16907,,1,We're gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families.
16908,,1,"And just many, many other things."
16909,,1,"I mean, we're gonna make some unbelievable changes and it's -- it's so easy."
16910,,1,"Again, you know regulations -- I'm traveling all over and I'm meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they're being laid off because of it."
16911,,1,"Regulations; if I told you -- and I'm so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise -- if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we're gonna -- you know, we're bringing it down to 15 percent from more than -- much more than double that."
16912,,1,"But if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially -- but in a real way -- cut regulations -- a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other."
16913,,1,"It's amazing, its amazing And that surprised me."
16914,,1,Surprised you too?
16915,,1,"Surprised him, too."
16916,,1,A hundred percent.
16917,,1,"I mean, everybody -- businesses can't form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can't form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don't do anything."
16918,,1,"We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations."
16919,,1,"We're not, you know, people that don't want these things."
16920,,1,We have to have that.
16921,,1,"We want clear air, we want clean water."
16922,,1,We want clear water.
16923,,1,"But -- but  To do that -- and there are certain things that you want to do, but to do that, you don't have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses."
16924,,1,"So you know, I just wrote this down today."
16925,,1,Hillary wants to raise taxes.
16926,,1,It's a comparison.
16927,,1,I want to lower them.
16928,,1,"Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league."
16929,,1,Can you believe that?
16930,,1,"I will reduce them very, very substantially."
16931,,1,"Could be as much as 70, 75 percent."
16932,,1,Hillary wants to shut down energy production.
16933,,1,I want to expand it.
16934,,1,"Lower electric -- lower electric bills, folks."
16935,,1,Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment.
16936,,1,"By the way, and if she gets to pick    If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks."
16937,,1,"Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is."
16938,,1,I don't know.
16939,,1,But -- but I'll tell you what.
16940,,1,That will be a horrible day.
16941,,1,"If -- if Hillary gets to put her judges -- right now, we're tied."
16942,,1,You see what's going on.
16943,,1,you see what's going on?
16944,,1,We tied because Scalia - this was not suppose to happen.
16945,,1,Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens.
16946,,1,That was a horrible thing.
16947,,1,So now look at it.
16948,,1,So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment.
16949,,1,"Now, speaking to the NRA folks - who are great - when you - when you -- and I'll tell you, they endorsed me."
16950,,1,They endorsed me very early.
16951,,1,My son's a member.
16952,,1,"I'm a member.If you - we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices - they almost go - in a certain way, hand in hand."
16953,,1,"Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected."
16954,,1,And have gotten great.
16955,,1,"And they to a little equate - but if you don't do the right thing, either you're not going to have a Second Amendment or you're not going to have much of it left."
16956,,1,"And you're not going to be able to protect yourself, which you needYou know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they're not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this?"
16957,,1,"OK, the bad guys aren't going to be giving up their weaponsBut the good people will say, ""oh, well, that's the law."""
16958,,1,"No, no, not going to happen, we can't let it happen."
16959,,1,We can't let it happen.
16960,,1,Hillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country.
16961,,1,"Where they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things."
16962,,1,"And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right?"
16963,,1,So you have drugs pouring in.
16964,,1,"You have everything coming in.You know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem."
16965,,1,"I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border."
16966,,1,They're going to stop.
16967,,1,"And by the way, we will build a wall."
16968,,1,That's legal.
16969,,1,Walls do work.
16970,,1,Walls do work.
16971,,1,"Now here's one and you know -- I mean she doesn't look that way, but she is -- Hillary wants to invade foreign countries."
16972,,1,That's what she does and look at the mess.
16973,,1,"So we've spent -- you know for two years, for three years, I've been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess."
16974,,1,Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East.
16975,,1,And I'm going to get the accurate number.
16976,,1,"They don't know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea."
16977,,1,They have no idea what we're doing.
16978,,1,"We're sending equipment over, the enemies take it in."
16979,,1,"We sent over 2,300 Humvees that are totally armor plated."
16980,,1,"They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300."
16981,,1,I thought they meant like two or 23.
16982,,1,"Or 230 was too much, 2,300 Humvees and they got stolen."
16983,,1,They got taken by the enemy.
16984,,1,"You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we're trying to get out."
16985,,1,"So, terrible."
16986,,1,Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
16987,,1,Big problem.
16988,,1,Big problem.
16989,,1,"Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that's wonderful, enjoy yourselves."
16990,,1,I want to work with our police.
16991,,1,"Our police are so incredible, they're not getting the respect they deserve."
16992,,1,Not getting the respect they deserve.
16993,,1,"And we're going to, in our country, restore law and order."
16994,,1,"We have to, we have to restore law and order."
16995,,1,And the police are going to be careful and they're going to be studied and they're going to be -- but we have to restore law and order.
16996,,1,"What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down."
16997,,1,"Absolutely, absolutely for no reason."
16998,,1,"Viciously shot down, and so many others."
16999,,1,I was with one of the police groups the other day.
17000,,1,They're endorsing me.
17001,,1,"Of like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed."
17002,,1,We have to respect and cherish our police.
17003,,1,"School choice we want, common core we don't want."
17004,,1,"We've got to get rid of common core, bring educational  And folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA."
17005,,1,"And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall."
17006,,1,That I can tell you.
17007,,1,"Listen, you know these politicians, they don't know me."
17008,,1,They don't understand me.
17009,,1,"And I am, I'm in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses."
17010,,1,These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can't support Donald Trump.
17011,,1,"The reason they can't, you know why, because I'm not going to hire these people, I don't want these people."
17012,,1,Take a look.
17013,,1,"Take a look at what these people -- these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things -- take a look what has happened in our country."
17014,,1,"Our military is depleted, our vets aren't taken care of."
17015,,1,We can't beat ISIS.
17016,,1,"Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur -- can you imagine -- and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it."
17017,,1,I love.
17018,,1,"But can you imagine them seeing that we can't beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can't beat them?"
17019,,1,We're fighting a political correct war.It's a political correct war.
17020,,1,"I mean, you know what's going on."
17021,,1,You know what's going on.
17022,,1,These are people that chop off heads.
17023,,1,"These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people."
17024,,1,These are people that buried people in the sand.
17025,,1,We've got to knock them out.I was against the war in Iraq.
17026,,1,We shouldn't have been to the war in Iraq.
17027,,1,It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen.
17028,,1,But we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.
17029,,1,The way we got out was insane.
17030,,1,"And Obama gave a date, and he -- and that's how ISIS happened, folks."
17031,,1,"Hence, the birth of ISIS."
17032,,1,"Congratulations, Hillary Clinton."
17033,,1,"Congratulate -- I mean, she -- she should get -- if I'm ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award."
17034,,1,OK?
17035,,1,"And I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made."
17036,,1,"Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that's the better alternative, all right?"
17037,,1,But he has been an incompetent president.
17038,,1,He has done a horrible job.
17039,,1,"And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again -- and he would only say this to his wife -- but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives."
17040,,1,And I mean lives on both sides.
17041,,1,I'm not just saying -- I mean lives on both sides.
17042,,1,"She's inept; she's inept.And to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK?"
17043,,1,It always will be.
17044,,1,"So -- so, I want to thank all of you for being here."
17045,,1,"Look, I'm going to be around, and we're going to be coming to North Carolina a lot."
17046,,1,"Got to win it, very important  But -- the people are great."
17047,,1,My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina.
17048,,1,I'm here all the time.
17049,,1,But -- but people -- the people are great.
17050,,1,The military is great.
17051,,1,We are going to make America great again.
17052,,1,We're going to start winning.
17053,,1,We're going to put America first.
17054,,1,"We're going to make America safe again.But never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.Thank you."
17055,,1,"Thank you, everybody."
17056,,1,I'll be back soon.
17057,,1,Thank you.
17058,,1,God bless you.
17059,,1,Thank you.
17060,,1,"Thank you, everybody."
17061,,1,Thank you.
17062,,1,Unbelievable.
17063,,1,Thank you very much.
17064,,1,Thank you very much.
17065,,1,It's a great honor.
17066,,1,Thank you.
17067,,1,[ ] Amazing.
17068,,1,Amazing.
17069,,1,What great people.We're going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania.
17070,,1,We're going to bring back our jobs to the United States.
17071,,1,"Going to bring back our jobs, folks."
17072,,1,I've looked at the numbers and I see what's happening in Pennsylvania.
17073,,1,"I see what's happening all over our country.You look at New York state, you look at New England, you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to, all over it's the same."
17074,,1,"Manufacturing way down, jobs way down."
17075,,1,"You go to other countries, they're taking our companies, they're taking our jobs."
17076,,1,People are right now working harder than they've ever worked.
17077,,1,"Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages, 18 years, think of it."
17078,,1,"Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room, and thank you for being here, you know it's 93 degrees out."
17079,,1,"And they still have a lot of people trying to get in, I don't know if they can get them in."
17080,,1,Should we let them in?
17081,,1,Just let them in.
17082,,1,"But 18 years ago, people were making more money in real wages than they make today."
17083,,1,"And today they're working two jobs, some people are working three jobs."
17084,,1,"So they're older, and they're working harder, and they're making less money, all right?"
17085,,1,"A friend of mine, I've been telling this story over the last month because it's better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study, because you learn it in three minutes."
17086,,1,But let me just tell you.
17087,,1,"Right now, Mexico and other countries are building facilities, plants, the likes of which you've never seen."
17088,,1,"We're going to build the wall, don't worry, we're going to build the wall, we're going to build it, we're going to build it."
17089,,1,"But a friend of mine, and actually a supporter, big supporter, great guy."
17090,,1,"He builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants."
17091,,1,"He doesn't want to build apartments, he doesn't want to build office buildings, he wants to build plants."
17092,,1,And he's just about the biggest there is.
17093,,1,And I said how are things going?
17094,,1,"He said very well, how are you doing in the U.S.?"
17095,,1,Not good.
17096,,1,How are you doing in Mexico?
17097,,1,"He said Donald do you want to see, it's the eighth wonder of the world."
17098,,1,"They are building plants, the likes of which I've never seen."
17099,,1,"He's building some of the greatest plants, big you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico."
17100,,1,The plants.
17101,,1,"You look at look at, take a look."
17102,,1,"By the way, millions of jobs, thousands of companies over the years, they've left us."
17103,,1,And we have a few things.
17104,,1,"We have unemployment, we have empty plants, I saw up in New York state, I saw it in Pennsylvania, you were great to meet, you voted a big victory for Donald Trump, thank you."
17105,,1,That was a big victory.
17106,,1,"I mean I assumed I was going if I don't win Pennsylvania and by the way, I was talking to our great Congressman, and where is he?"
17107,,1,"He's here some place, where is he?"
17108,,1,"He loves the people, and I have to say, of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well."
17109,,1,Thank you.
17110,,1,"But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here, we have a few of the friends and we see what's happened with General Electric where they're cutting way back."
17111,,1,Not going to happen.
17112,,1,"And you know why they're cutting back, it's one reason."
17113,,1,Because we don't take care of our miners and we're not producing coal.
17114,,1,"And they don't need to make those big, big beautiful, you could call them locomotives I guess, right?"
17115,,1,"Whatever the hell they are, they're big and they're powerful and they don't need them like they used to because we don't make our government work for us."
17116,,1,They're not working for us.
17117,,1,"They're working for others, they're not working for us."
17118,,1,"So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers, I see the numbers, and it's about coal, so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia, and the coal industry's decimated."
17119,,1,"The miners are out of work, they're totally out of work."
17120,,1,I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon.
17121,,1,"And we're talking clean coal, we're talking clean coal.So I was with the miners, we have such tremendous support, West Virginia, the mining parts of Virginia."
17122,,1,"All over, Ohio, because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago."
17123,,1,"A number of months she said, we're going to put the mines and miners out of business."
17124,,1,All right?
17125,,1,"Going to put the mines and the miners so  So, we're not going to let that happen."
17126,,1,We're not going to let that happen and we're not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what?
17127,,1,"A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs, but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines."
17128,,1,"Like, as an example, General Electric."
17129,,1,"And what we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special."
17130,,1,We're going to bring it back.
17131,,1,"We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our companies."
17132,,1,"When a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think they're going to make their product, and because our politicians are weak, stupid, taken care of by lobbyists, special interests they're taken care of by lobbyists, they're taken care of by donors and special interests."
17133,,1,"That's what you know, a friend of mine very smart guy said I can't believe it."
17134,,1,We're talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.
17135,,1,"He said, I can't believe they could have gotten that through."
17136,,1,"I said, Why can't you believe it?"
17137,,1,"Well, it's so bad for the country."
17138,,1,"I said, Yeah, but it's good for the politician because they're taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests."
17139,,1,"So even though you say we want, as an example, General Electric to produce more, if they don't want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesn't want that to happen, even though it's great for Erie, even though it's great you, even though it's great for the state of Pennsylvania, then it's not going to happen, folks."
17140,,1,It's not going to happen.
17141,,1,And by the way and I have to tell you this.
17142,,1,"So when they think they're going to take our companies are rip them out of as an example this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you, and you're going to lose your jobs or you're going to now get two part- time jobs that don't add up to half of what you used to make."
17143,,1,That stuff isn't happening anymore.
17144,,1,So here's what happens.
17145,,1,They're going to build that plant.
17146,,1,"Now, if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States that's my title, secretary of keeping business in the United States."
17147,,1,"I mean, I like the sound of secretary of defense better."
17148,,1,"Oh, and by the way, we're going to build our military."
17149,,1,We're going to be very strong.
17150,,1,Really.
17151,,1,And we're going to take care of our vets.
17152,,1,"We're going to take care of our vets, believe me."
17153,,1,But I like the sound I like the sound of secretary of Defense.
17154,,1,I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury.
17155,,1,I like the sound of secretary of State.
17156,,1,"But I'll tell you, would I be good at keeping jobs over here."
17157,,1,Would I be   I'll tell you this.
17158,,1,"I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much, much stronger."
17159,,1,"They had much more passion, I have to say."
17160,,1,All right.
17161,,1,You know what's interesting?
17162,,1,"If I could speak to them for like five minutes we want a strong military, we want to take care of our people, we want good education, we want good housing, we want good healthcare."
17163,,1,What do we want?
17164,,1,We're all in for the same thing.
17165,,1,Really amazing.
17166,,1,Really amazing.
17167,,1,"So I'll be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States, right?"
17168,,1,"So, I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner, which decided to leave Indianapolis, Indiana, and I would say here's the story."
17169,,1,We think it's wonderful that you're negotiating with Mexico.
17170,,1,"I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful plant, but here's what's going to happen."
17171,,1,"If you build that plant and you fire all of these people, 1400 people who were so great to me."
17172,,1,"Indiana, I won that in a landslide."
17173,,1,"Actually, the timing was good."
17174,,1,I won it in a landslide because I know what to do.
17175,,1,Hillary doesn't know what to do.
17176,,1,Did you see her yesterday?
17177,,1,She has no clue about what we're talking about.
17178,,1,"Folks, she has no clue."
17179,,1,She has no clue.
17180,,1,Crooked Hillary.
17181,,1,"She doesn't know anything about it and, by the way, if she did, she couldn't do it anyway because her donors don't want to do it."
17182,,1,There's reasons.
17183,,1,"But look, look."
17184,,1,I would go to them and say just to keep them.
17185,,1,Just to keep them.
17186,,1,And I wouldn't even care that much.
17187,,1,I'll tell you why.
17188,,1,Ready?
17189,,1,I'd say here's the story.
17190,,1,"If you leave, in this case, Indianapolis, you're going to go to Mexico, you're going to make your air conditioning units."
17191,,1,"Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit."
17192,,1,OK?
17193,,1,Thirty five percent.
17194,,1,Right?
17195,,1,So simple.
17196,,1,Thirty five percent the cost of that unit.
17197,,1,We hope you enjoy your new plant.
17198,,1,"Very hot weather out there, very hot."
17199,,1,"We hope you enjoy your new plant, but 35 percent is coming to us."
17200,,1,"Now, here's what's going to happen if they haven't moved yet."
17201,,1,A lot of them have moved.
17202,,1,"We've lost thousands and thousands of companies, we've lost millions of jobs - too late."
17203,,1,I should have been there 10 years ago.
17204,,1,Nobody would have left.
17205,,1,"Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger, you know, I'm your messenger in terms of this movement."
17206,,1,But you need the right person saying it.
17207,,1,"So, here's what's going to happen."
17208,,1,"Normally they'd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and they'd have one of their lobbyists call up and they'd say Hillary, I'm sorry, you can't do that, they gave you $2 million for your campaign."
17209,,1,"Can't do that, Hillary."
17210,,1,"OK, I won't do that."
17211,,1,"With me, I'm putting my money up, folks."
17212,,1,I'm putting my money up.
17213,,1,Putting my money up.
17214,,1,"We're raising money for Reince and for the RNC, but that's for a lot of other reasons."
17215,,1,We are putting - I'm putting a lot of money up.
17216,,1,"I financed my - I funded, not financed, I wish I financed, right?"
17217,,1,I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures.
17218,,1,"So, here's a story - wouldn't that be nice?"
17219,,1,I spent less and won in a landslide.
17220,,1,"Other people spent much, much more."
17221,,1,"Three, four, five times more and they came in seventh."
17222,,1,"Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right?"
17223,,1,Right?
17224,,1,Right?
17225,,1,"Oh, boy, and then they don't like me - couple of them, most of them have really supported us, but some of them just can't get over it."
17226,,1,You know what I say to them?
17227,,1,Get over it.
17228,,1,We're just having fun.
17229,,1,Get over it.
17230,,1,"You signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know, the funny thing, all those pledges, you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it."
17231,,1,"And I would have honored it, I will say."
17232,,1,Even if I wasn't fond or didn't like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing.
17233,,1,But here's the thing.
17234,,1,"So, we are going to take these companies that haven't left - now, I'm looking at your numbers folks, you're not doing too well."
17235,,1,You're not doing too well here.
17236,,1,"Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know, that's massive, since NAFTA."
17237,,1,NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe it's the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.
17238,,1,It's one of the most one-sided documents that I've ever seen.
17239,,1,And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense.
17240,,1,"And did you see where say, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA, I'm going to TPP disaster."
17241,,1,"Ok, don't worry."
17242,,1,Don't worry.
17243,,1,And Hillary was in favor of TPP.
17244,,1,She said it's the gold standard.
17245,,1,Thank you for reminding me.
17246,,1,I like this guy.
17247,,1,It's the gold standard.
17248,,1,TPP.
17249,,1,Transpacific Partnership.
17250,,1,It is going to be I don't think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly.
17251,,1,But it's going to be as bad as NAFTA.
17252,,1,"So TPP, she said it is the gold standard."
17253,,1,She's reading it from a teleprompter.
17254,,1,"It is the gold standard oh, boy."
17255,,1,Our country is in trouble.
17256,,1,Our country is in trouble.
17257,,1,Our country is in trouble.
17258,,1,So she said it's the gold standard.
17259,,1,"But when she heard me make a speech, as I understand it."
17260,,1,And she heard me talking very negatively about it.
17261,,1,"As an example, they don't talk devaluation, which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States, including China."
17262,,1,They devalue their currency.
17263,,1,"Well, it doesn't happen."
17264,,1,Number one thing is not mentioned.
17265,,1,"So complicated, this agreement."
17266,,1,Too many countries.
17267,,1,"By the way, I believe trade."
17268,,1,I believe in trade deals.
17269,,1,One country at a time.
17270,,1,Boom.
17271,,1,Boom.
17272,,1,Boom.
17273,,1,You got to see the lines.
17274,,1,We'll have one line.
17275,,1,And if they don't do well.
17276,,1,"If they don't behave themselves, if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place, very simple, we write them a notice like we do in business."
17277,,1,We serve them with a 30 day notice.
17278,,1,"And by the way, you just saw, how great are our police, right?"
17279,,1,Law and order.
17280,,1,We need law and order.
17281,,1,We need law and order and we will have law and order.
17282,,1,"Our police, our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job."
17283,,1,They are not recognized for the great job they do.
17284,,1,"If they have 500,000 incidents all positively, beautifully handled, one bad thing happens, that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it's a disgrace."
17285,,1,It's a disgrace.
17286,,1,So we should be very thankful for the job they do.
17287,,1,"So, Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business."
17288,,1,"Right now, we're sitting here, we're talking - oh, here's another one."
17289,,1,Go home to Mom.
17290,,1,Go home to Mom.
17291,,1,And your mother is voting for trump!
17292,,1,She's voting for Trump.
17293,,1,It's true.
17294,,1,"It's true.By the way, just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat."
17295,,1,"And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in."
17296,,1,"They said, the came up to me, this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy came up to me and said I've never seen anything like it."
17297,,1,It always goes Democrat.
17298,,1,Is that a correct statement?
17299,,1,"Said, you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - you're going to win in a landslide."
17300,,1,Gonna be a landslide.
17301,,1,"Because people are tired of lies, they're tired of losing their jobs, they're tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places."
17302,,1,"They're tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business, so we have to go to China to get our steel, which is happening very quickly."
17303,,1,"And that's why the steel workers are with me, that's why the miners are with me, that's why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they're all - they're with us."
17304,,1,"And I grew up, you know they say, you know you're really rich, how come you sort of relate to these people?"
17305,,1,"Well, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians, I got to know all these people, I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters I got to know them all."
17306,,1,And I liked them better than the rich people that I know.
17307,,1,I know a lot of rich people.
17308,,1,It's true.
17309,,1,They're better.
17310,,1,"I like them better.So, anyway and, we are going to put people back to work."
17311,,1,We're not playing games.
17312,,1,And it's going to go quickly.
17313,,1,"By the way, it's going to go quickly.But look at this, OK."
17314,,1,"So, Erie, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs."
17315,,1,"You know that, all I you do I flew over, you're looking at the plants, plants that 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, some two years ago, were vibrant."
17316,,1,"But no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half, down to a quarter, down to a tenth, and then ultimately they closed, but you see them."
17317,,1,They are falling over.
17318,,1,"The rain, the sleet, the snow, the wind."
17319,,1,These are great buildings that are falling apart.
17320,,1,"Don't feel bad, all over the country."
17321,,1,"Upstate New York is a disaster, which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix."
17322,,1,"OK, so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and that's fine."
17323,,1,"But they wrote a story, I couldn't believe I saw this story, they talked about Hillary Clinton."
17324,,1,"It was a headline, Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York, she said to the people in upstate New York, which was starting to really have problems because of her husband's bill NAFTA."
17325,,1,"And companies were leaving, tremendous unemployment, tremendous problems, making nothing and she said I will turn it around, I will create 200,000 jobs, we're going to do a great job."
17326,,1,Guess what?
17327,,1,"She got elected, she did nothing."
17328,,1,And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out.
17329,,1,It is a disaster.
17330,,1,"upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania, she did nothing."
17331,,1,"And I watched her yesterday, which was hard to do, because she is boring, OK?"
17332,,1,I watched her yesterday talking about you know what's funny?
17333,,1,"I said I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you can't make a deal, I said we're going to terminate, we're getting out."
17334,,1,"And  So I've been saying that and I've been saying we're going to renegotiate different trade deals, and we're going to make great trade deals and all this and she's never said that."
17335,,1,"All of a sudden, two days ago, I will renegotiate trade deals."
17336,,1,"She's not going to do it, folks."
17337,,1,"She's going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200,000 jobs in upstate New York."
17338,,1,"It turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you, I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story."
17339,,1,Because you what they're doing?
17340,,1,"And Reince was alluding to it a little bit, the only way she gets elected is if they don't report on her."
17341,,1,They don't show her.
17342,,1,They have me on so much television.
17343,,1,"There's CNN, you talk about dishonesty, it's called the Clinton wait it's called the Clinton News Network, CNN."
17344,,1,"Now, think of it, Clinton is She's hardly ever on."
17345,,1,"So yesterday, they have yesterday, a scandal with the emails, another one."
17346,,1,"I'm not talking about the 33,000 emails that she deleted or got rid of."
17347,,1,Can you imagine what was on those emails?
17348,,1,Can you imagine?
17349,,1,I love that.
17350,,1,"Can you imagine what was on those emails, 33,000 emails were deleted."
17351,,1,And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.
17352,,1,"I give two to yoga, I give five to the wedding."
17353,,1,"I'll tell you, the lies, the deception."
17354,,1,"We're running like they run right now a third world country folks, OK?"
17355,,1,"You saw what happened, it's running like a third world country, we're being talked about all over the world, nobody can believe it."
17356,,1,"In fact, when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton, one after another after another after another, however, and yet other people, their lives have been destroyed for doing much less, all right?"
17357,,1,Their lives have been destroyed.
17358,,1,So now they have a big scandal in New York.
17359,,1,"It's in the New York papers, but very little."
17360,,1,Pay right?
17361,,1,Pay for play.
17362,,1,"And it's horrifying, it's horrifying."
17363,,1,Our government is for sale.
17364,,1,Our government is for sale by a crooked person.
17365,,1,And what they're doing is they're trying to not talk about her.
17366,,1,Take a look.
17367,,1,You go to CNN as an example.
17368,,1,Story after story about Trump.
17369,,1,Story Trump.
17370,,1,Trump.
17371,,1,Trump.
17372,,1,Trump.
17373,,1,"And yesterday, it was announced that people are tired of negative the hit jobs and CNN's starting to do very poorly."
17374,,1,That's good.
17375,,1,I like that.
17376,,1,I like that.
17377,,1,"And I have to say, Fox has been treating us fairly."
17378,,1,Fox has been fair.
17379,,1,But CNN has been catastrophic.
17380,,1,It's so dishonest.
17381,,1,But somebody was explaining to me their theory.
17382,,1,"If they don't report on her, people aren't going to know how bad she is."
17383,,1,Look at her news conference.
17384,,1,She hasn't had a news conference in like 260 days.
17385,,1,That last one wasn't a news conference.
17386,,1,That was a few of her friends.
17387,,1,They asked her a question.
17388,,1,"What did she say about the circuit, right?"
17389,,1,"Let me tell you, if I ever said that, short- circuited, if I ever said I short-circuited, it would be headlines all over the world."
17390,,1,They would call for the death penalty.
17391,,1,Can you imagine if I said that I short-circuited?
17392,,1,"I mean, I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds, she gets 300 people going to her events."
17393,,1,She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep.
17394,,1,And then she wakes and she goes again.
17395,,1,And I'm telling you and nobody does anything about it.
17396,,1,"Now me, I stand up here I'm not looking at notes."
17397,,1,I'm not reading teleprompters.
17398,,1,Not easy.
17399,,1,Not easy.
17400,,1,Not easy.
17401,,1,"But but remember but and if I make one mistake   say, he mention something wrong."
17402,,1,He got a wrong date.
17403,,1,It's like headlines all over.
17404,,1,She can say she short-circuited up here.
17405,,1,I don't want a president who short-circuits.
17406,,1,Is that OK?
17407,,1,I don't want it.
17408,,1,I don't want a president who short-circuits.
17409,,1,We've got to deal with ISIS.
17410,,1,We've got to deal with China.
17411,,1,We've got to deal with lots of people.
17412,,1,They're not short-circuiting.
17413,,1,But I don't want somebody that short-circuits.
17414,,1,So let me just tell you let me just tell you.
17415,,1,"Over the last little while you know, every time, it's always a big deal."
17416,,1,"When I said that Obama and of course, I'm being sarcastic."
17417,,1,"And they know that because after I said that, I said he's the MVP, he's going to collect his MVP award."
17418,,1,OK.
17419,,1,So I said Obama is the founder of ISIS.
17420,,1,The founder.
17421,,1,And these dishonest media people they're the most dishonest people.
17422,,1,"They said oh, did he mean that?"
17423,,1,Didn't he mean that?
17424,,1,"And after that, I'd say a lot in fact, they like him so much because he's been so weak and so bad."
17425,,1,"I mean, he let this happen."
17426,,1,They had eight states.
17427,,1,They had eight countries.
17428,,1,They're now in 28 countries.
17429,,1,They're expanding.
17430,,1,"So I said the founder of obviously, I'm being sarcastic."
17431,,1,"Then then but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you."
17432,,1,"And they all said, he should not say that."
17433,,1,They should call him an enabler.
17434,,1,Call him an enabler.
17435,,1,He's an enabler.
17436,,1,"I said, that doesn't sound the same."
17437,,1,He's an enabler.
17438,,1,People are going to say what's these people are the worst.
17439,,1,"But listen, so I said the founder of ISIS."
17440,,1,"And in fact, very soon he's going over to pick up his most valuable player award."
17441,,1,Did I say that?
17442,,1,I say it all the time.
17443,,1,TRUMP  So they knew I was being sarcastic.
17444,,1,By now they're analyzing.
17445,,1,Did I really mean that?
17446,,1,How could I say that?
17447,,1,These people are the lowest form of life.
17448,,1,I'm telling you.
17449,,1,The lowest.
17450,,1,They are the lowest form of humanity.
17451,,1,Not all of them.
17452,,1,"They have about 25 percent that are pretty good, actually."
17453,,1,But most of them.OK.
17454,,1,"So, here's the story."
17455,,1,So Erie has lost a lot.
17456,,1,Right?
17457,,1,"You know that, right?"
17458,,1,"Hang in, don't leave."
17459,,1,I promise we can fix it so fast.
17460,,1,We will stop these countries from taking our jobs.
17461,,1,We will stop these countries from taking our companies.
17462,,1,Hold on.
17463,,1,Our jobs will come back.
17464,,1,"Now, I came up with a great plan."
17465,,1,"I'm lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay, so I don't even have to make the call."
17466,,1,"The corporate inversions - you know, we have companies that have, they say, two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they can't get their money back."
17467,,1,We don't let them.
17468,,1,Everybody agrees that we should do it.
17469,,1,"Republicans, Democrats, everybody agrees.What's the - look, why do we not want them to bring money back?"
17470,,1,You know why?
17471,,1,"Because we don't have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let's bring this money back in so we can work it in this country, right?"
17472,,1,That's what it is.
17473,,1,"So we're going to bring that money back in, we're going to lower taxes, we're going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave, they're going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in."
17474,,1,OK?
17475,,1,That's what's going to happen.
17476,,1,"So, the existing U.S. trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68,000 jobs, folks."
17477,,1,"No more, folks."
17478,,1,"We're not going to be stupid people any more, we're going to be the really, really smart people."
17479,,1,It's going to be America first.
17480,,1,America first.
17481,,1,America first.
17482,,1,First.
17483,,1,"So, the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clinton's and her husband's disastrous trade policies.I mean, you take a look at what she's done."
17484,,1,"At the bidding of her corporate funders, Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades."
17485,,1,"She has received so much money, she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her."
17486,,1,Yesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases.
17487,,1,"We're the highest taxed nation in the land, essentially."
17488,,1,We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
17489,,1,Anywhere in the world.
17490,,1,"And of the industrialized nations, we're far and away the highest taxed nation."
17491,,1,And she's proposing a massive tax increase.
17492,,1,"Folks, we can't do it."
17493,,1,It's going to make our country non-competitive - it's already non-competitive.
17494,,1,It's going to make our country non-competitive and we're not going to do it.
17495,,1,"I'm proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class, for business, and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed."
17496,,1,"Businesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high, they're going to stay."
17497,,1,I might not even have to make those calls.
17498,,1,"Now, if I do, I will, meaning my people will."
17499,,1,"I'll do some, I love doing it."
17500,,1,I would love telling some guy you're not moving.
17501,,1,"Well, Mr. President, sir, we would like to move to Mexico."
17502,,1,You're not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax.
17503,,1,"You say Well, in that case, I'm not moving, I'm not moving."
17504,,1,"In that case, I'm not moving."
17505,,1,So easy.
17506,,1,"So, your coal industry, your steel industry, which has been ravaged, your General Electrics of the world, which have been ravaged, just ravaged, we're going to end it and I'll tell you why."
17507,,1,"Over the years, I've watched."
17508,,1,"For years, for 10 years, for 12 years, for 15 years, beyond Obama, and I've watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states."
17509,,1,"You need strength, is right."
17510,,1,Our states.
17511,,1,And I watched.
17512,,1,Remember they give the low-interest loans?
17513,,1,"Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania, here's a zero-interest loan, you don't have to pay, here's a this, here's tax abatement of any kind you want, we'll help your - it doesn't work, folks, that's not what they need."
17514,,1,They have money.
17515,,1,"They want to go out, they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb, they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution, not have any consequences.So all of that's over and I think you understand it and Hillary can't do it."
17516,,1,"Number one, she can't do it because the mentality isn't there."
17517,,1,She can't do it.
17518,,1,"No, the mentality."
17519,,1,"You know, she said fairly recently, I don't like Donald Trump's tone."
17520,,1,His tone isn't nice.
17521,,1,"And I said, here we have a country that's being taken advantage of by every country in the world."
17522,,1,Our businesses are being taken.
17523,,1,Our jobs being taken.
17524,,1,Everything's being taken.
17525,,1,"Here we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone."
17526,,1,"Folks, we better get smart, folks."
17527,,1,"Hey, look, let's see what happens."
17528,,1,We better get smart.
17529,,1,We better get smart.
17530,,1,We better get smart.
17531,,1,We better get tough.
17532,,1,"And if we're not smart and we're not tough, we're not going to have a country left."
17533,,1,And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders.
17534,,1,Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country.
17535,,1,"In fact, I brought something for you people."
17536,,1,I brought I brought I had to do this.
17537,,1,I didn't want to depress you.
17538,,1,"OK, look."
17539,,1,The Clinton legacy.
17540,,1,"Nearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie, PA Erie, PA, sound familiar have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen."
17541,,1,"Now, look at this look at this chart."
17542,,1,"This is 2001, not long ago."
17543,,1,This is now.
17544,,1,"Congratulations, folks."
17545,,1,I hope you're doing well.
17546,,1,OK?
17547,,1,I hope you're doing well.
17548,,1,I don't want to hurt them.
17549,,1,I hope you're doing well.
17550,,1,But you know what?
17551,,1,You can't do well.
17552,,1,"When you have a government that is so stupid, that is so that is so incompetent, you can't do it."
17553,,1,"Here's another one, folks."
17554,,1,This is what we're talking about.
17555,,1,"Syrian refugees we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from, no paperwork."
17556,,1,You saw what happened in San Bernardino.
17557,,1,"You saw what happened frankly, take a look at all over the world."
17558,,1,Take a look at what's happening.
17559,,1,If we don't get smart and we don't get smart fast Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands.
17560,,1,"Now, I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want, by the way, the Gulf states to pay for it because they've got plenty of money and they're not doing much."
17561,,1,OK?
17562,,1,We'll supervise it.
17563,,1,"OPM, other people's money."
17564,,1,"We'll supervise it, right?"
17565,,1,We'll supervise it.
17566,,1,But they're going to pay for it because we're protecting these people.
17567,,1,"If it weren't for the United States, those countries wouldn't even exist."
17568,,1,They'd be gone.
17569,,1,"The power we have is so enormous, but we have people that don't know what they're doing."
17570,,1,We have an incompetent president.
17571,,1,We have people that don't know what they're doing.
17572,,1,So look at this.
17573,,1,Look at this.
17574,,1,Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis.
17575,,1,Look what's happening.
17576,,1,Look what's happening.
17577,,1,"Now, in all fairness, we want to help people."
17578,,1,Can't take a chance.
17579,,1,"San Bernardino, they walk in."
17580,,1,They start shooting.
17581,,1,"Paris, the best, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, France."
17582,,1,They walk in.
17583,,1,They kill 130 people.
17584,,1,They wound so gravely hundreds of people.
17585,,1,"Now, let me just tell you because well we're on the Second Amendment, right, Second Amendment."
17586,,1,"If we had in San Bernardino if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace, somebody in that room like this guy right here, right, or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair."
17587,,1,I wish I had hair that looked like that.
17588,,1,"But if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun, San Bernardino, they see him come in first of all, if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction, they probably wouldn't have got   in, OK?"
17589,,1,But let's assume they did.The carnage would not have been what the carnage was.
17590,,1,We have to protect our Second Amendment.
17591,,1,Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment.
17592,,1,She wants to kill it.
17593,,1,So here's our chart.
17594,,1,"And I was thinking about doing a I bring every once in a like, one in ten I do it, you know a lot of these."
17595,,1,I love the people.
17596,,1,We have such a movement going on.
17597,,1,Who likes the snake?
17598,,1,Do you know the snake?
17599,,1,Do you like it?
17600,,1,Who likes the snake?
17601,,1,Here we are with this.
17602,,1,We know bad things are going to happen.
17603,,1,"We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas, bad things are going to happen."
17604,,1,Has anybody heard the snake?
17605,,1,Not that many?
17606,,1,Should I do it again?
17607,,1,"So think of this, folks, think of this, think of it."
17608,,1,This is what is going on in our country with our borders.
17609,,1,"And by the way, we're going to have a strong border, we're going to have a wall, it's going to be a powerful wall that Mexico's going to pay for the wall."
17610,,1,"And we have no choice, and we have no choice."
17611,,1,But think of this.
17612,,1,"This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to what's happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled, it has to do with a lot of different things but when you're listening to this, think of our border, think of the people that we're letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton, you saw those numbers right?"
17613,,1,"With the chart, it's through the roof."
17614,,1,Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country.
17615,,1,How stupid are we?
17616,,1,"So, are you ready, you ready, you like it, you sure?"
17617,,1,"On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew."
17618,,1,"Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you."
17619,,1,"Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake, take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake."
17620,,1,"She wrapped him up, all cozy, in a curvature of silk."
17621,,1,Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk.
17622,,1,Now she hurried home from work that night.
17623,,1,"As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in, had been revived."
17624,,1,"Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake."
17625,,1,"Take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake."
17626,,1,Now she clutched him to her bosom.
17627,,1,"You're so beautiful, she cried."
17628,,1,"But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly would have died."
17629,,1,Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
17630,,1,"But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite."
17631,,1,"Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake."
17632,,1,"Take me in oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake."
17633,,1,"I saved you, I saved you, I saved you, cried that woman."
17634,,1,"And you've bit me, heaven's why."
17635,,1,You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die.
17636,,1,"Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin."
17637,,1,You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
17638,,1,"Get ready folks, get ready."
17639,,1,We're led by stupid people.
17640,,1,"We're led by leaders and you know honestly, I didn't need this."
17641,,1,This I didn't need.
17642,,1,"I had a nice life, built a great company a great company, some of the great real estate assets of the world."
17643,,1,I may never see them.
17644,,1,"You know if I win, I may never see them again, and I love them all over the world."
17645,,1,But you know what?
17646,,1,This is so important.
17647,,1,"And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal, and I watched what was happening with jobs, and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us."
17648,,1,I look and I saw.
17649,,1,Take a look at Mexico.
17650,,1,"You know, the politicians say, you'll never, ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall."
17651,,1,I say trust me.
17652,,1,"Now, they don't say that anymore."
17653,,1,"Now they say, they won't put the money up to build a wall."
17654,,1,So easy.
17655,,1,"Mexico our trade deficit is massive, massive."
17656,,1,They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.
17657,,1,"Mexico will 100 percent you hear 100 percent pay for the wall, 100 percent."
17658,,1,OK?
17659,,1,One hundred percent.
17660,,1,But the story of the snake is what's happening to our country.
17661,,1,We're letting people in.
17662,,1,Many of these people hate us.
17663,,1,Many of these people don't have good thoughts.
17664,,1,And you see what one person can do one sick wacko can do in Orlando.
17665,,1,"And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face with a big, fat smile on his face, right?"
17666,,1,"And he was wearing a red hat, and I said, I hope that's not one of my hats."
17667,,1,It wasn't.
17668,,1,I was concerned.
17669,,1,I saw that hat.
17670,,1,"I said, I hope it doesn't say make America great again."
17671,,1,Bad guy bad guy.
17672,,1,Horrendous son horrendous son.
17673,,1,"So here's the story, folks."
17674,,1,"We have to win we have to win Pennsylvania, so important."
17675,,1,So  Hillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally.
17676,,1,They're very good.
17677,,1,They keep her out of the spotlight.
17678,,1,She doesn't talk to reporters very rarely.
17679,,1,She doesn't do press conferences.
17680,,1,She doesn't expose whatever's going on up here.
17681,,1,She doesn't which isn't good.
17682,,1,She doesn't expose her mind to questions.
17683,,1,And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.
17684,,1,We need strength.
17685,,1,We need toughness.
17686,,1,We need a strong temperament.
17687,,1,We need a strong tone.
17688,,1,"At the same time at the same time, let me tell you at the same time, we need real, big, beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare."
17689,,1,Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced.
17690,,1,It's going to repay did you see did you see what's happening with Obamacare?
17691,,1,"Did you see where the numbers are going up 30, 40, and 50 percent?"
17692,,1,Wait until you see what happens on November 1st.
17693,,1,"Now, on November 1st, they're trying to delay it."
17694,,1,"But you're going to get increases, the likes of which probably no country, nobody has ever seen."
17695,,1,OK?
17696,,1,"Anybody in the history of healthcare in Texas, through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield, they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums."
17697,,1,"And the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death, you'll never, ever be able to use your healthcare the healthcare."
17698,,1,Because here's what's happened here's what's happened.
17699,,1,"The deductible is so high, you never get to use it."
17700,,1,"So, you're spending money, your deductibles raises by 17, 18, 19 percent."
17701,,1,"But now, it's going to go really bad, really bad."
17702,,1,"It's going to die of its own volition, but we have to kill it first."
17703,,1,"It's killing our country, it's killing our jobs it's killing our jobs."
17704,,1,"So, here's the story, folks folks."
17705,,1,We have to win Pennsylvania.
17706,,1,We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own for their own purposes.
17707,,1,We have to win Pennsylvania.
17708,,1,"We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it."
17709,,1,"You know, we're up in Florida."
17710,,1,We're doing well in Ohio.
17711,,1,And I'm hearing we're doing well here.
17712,,1,We'll find out.
17713,,1,Here's the story   Here's the story.
17714,,1,We have to win the state of Pennsylvania.
17715,,1,I went to school here.
17716,,1,My kids went to school here.
17717,,1,"We're going to win Pennsylvania.If we win Pennsylvania, I'll tell you what."
17718,,1,We are very much on our way.
17719,,1,"You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you not my fault."
17720,,1,Not my fault.
17721,,1,It's a tougher path.
17722,,1,"For the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road."
17723,,1,"But if win Pennsylvania, we win Florida where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio, it'll be over."
17724,,1,It'll be over.
17725,,1,It'll be over.
17726,,1,"So, on November 8th, you have to get out and vote or do some balloting, and I don't care look, here's the story."
17727,,1,"If you're not feeling well, if you're so sick, if you go to your doctor and he goes, I'm sorry sir, but you've only got a few weeks left."
17728,,1,And it's November 1st.
17729,,1,"And he gives you the ultimate word, not looking good."
17730,,1,You haven't got long left.
17731,,1,I don't care and nobody else in this room cares.
17732,,1,"You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote, right?"
17733,,1,Get out and vote.
17734,,1,"Now, in a lot of cases, you can do your early ballots too."
17735,,1,"All I'm telling you though look, folks."
17736,,1,I'm just saying your jobs have been taken.
17737,,1,"Your military and all of the other things, we're going to save your Second Amendment, which is protection, we're going to get of Common Core, you're going to bring your education locally."
17738,,1,All things I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
17739,,1,All these things.
17740,,1,We're going to take care of our vets.
17741,,1,"But here's the story, folks."
17742,,1,For you people in particular because you have been devastated.
17743,,1,"Supreme Court, he said."
17744,,1,Yes.
17745,,1,Yes.
17746,,1,Thank you.
17747,,1,Who did that?
17748,,1,Who said that?
17749,,1,"Thank you.By the way, and I have to just stop for a second."
17750,,1,"Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia great."
17751,,1,Was supposed to live for a long time.
17752,,1,He died.
17753,,1,So you have already an empty.
17754,,1,This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president.
17755,,1,Could take more justices than it could be up to five.
17756,,1,"Probably going to be three, could be four, could be five."
17757,,1,OK?
17758,,1,"If Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court, number one, your Second Amendment will be gone."
17759,,1,Our country will never ever be the same.
17760,,1,"We will have problems like we've never had before and you won't have you will have a whole different deal going, which we don't want, believe me."
17761,,1,"So, here's the story."
17762,,1,"If for no other reason, I am going to put and you know, I've picked through Federalist society we picked 11 Supreme Court justices."
17763,,1,"We're going to add probably four more, all vetted through Federalists, through Heritage, highly I actually got very good marks."
17764,,1,We're going to pick these people or people very like that.
17765,,1,"So, here's the story, here's the story."
17766,,1,You ready?
17767,,1,"We don't win anymore, you people don't win, that's for sure."
17768,,1,You just have to look at the statistics for jobs.
17769,,1,We're going to start winning again.
17770,,1,We're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning.
17771,,1,You're going to say Mr. President you're going to send the congressman to see me in Washington.
17772,,1,"He's going to say, Mr. President, we have to do something."
17773,,1,"The people of Pennsylvania, and in particular our friends in Erie, they're sick and tired of winning."
17774,,1,They can't stand winning so much.
17775,,1,"Mr. President, we just don't want to win that much."
17776,,1,"We really want to give other nations like it used to be, where it's good for them and bad for us, at least a little bit."
17777,,1,"And I'm going to say I'm going to say, Mr."
17778,,1,"Congressman, I don't think you know your people very well, they want to win."
17779,,1,And we want to win.
17780,,1,And you want to win.
17781,,1,And we're going to win.
17782,,1,We're going to win so much.
17783,,1,"We're going to win with our military, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS."
17784,,1,We're going to win for our vets.
17785,,1,We're going to take of our vets.
17786,,1,"We're going to win at the border, we're going to build a wall, we're going to have Mexico pay, believe me 100 percent."
17787,,1,We're going to win with education.
17788,,1,We're going to win for our Second Amendment.
17789,,1,We're going to win on all of the things we discussed.
17790,,1,We're going to win again and you're going to be proud of your country again.
17791,,1,"We're not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what we're doing, for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have."
17792,,1,We are going to win.
17793,,1,We are going to be America first.
17794,,1,We are going to make America great again.
17795,,1,And it's going to happen quickly.
17796,,1,"Thank you everybody, thank you."
17797,,1,"Thank you, everybody, thank you very much."
17798,,1,It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again.
17799,,1,"In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism."
17800,,1,"Now, a different threat faces our world  radical Islamic terrorism."
17801,,1,"This summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours."
17802,,1,"Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another  thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood."
17803,,1,"The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers ."
17804,,1,"In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center."
17805,,1,"Last September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured."
17806,,1,"In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando ."
17807,,1,Another fifty-three were badly injured.
17808,,1,"It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what  we can never, ever allow this to happen again."
17809,,1,In Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies.
17810,,1,"In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed."
17811,,1,"Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded."
17812,,1,"Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen."
17813,,1,"In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today."
17814,,1,France is suffering gravely.
17815,,1,And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way.
17816,,1,In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people.
17817,,1,"This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.Terrible."
17818,,1,"Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son."
17819,,1,A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack.
17820,,1,"Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees."
17821,,1,"A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.Overseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another."
17822,,1,"Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution."
17823,,1,Holy sites desecrated.
17824,,1,Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination.
17825,,1,"ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.We cannot let this evil continue."
17826,,1,Thank you.
17827,,1,Thank you.
17828,,1,"Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries."
17829,,1,We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before.
17830,,1,"But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices."
17831,,1,We have a president that doesn't want to say the words.
17832,,1,Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country.
17833,,1,"Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president."
17834,,1,The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton.
17835,,1,Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over.
17836,,1,Libya was stable.
17837,,1,Syria was under control.
17838,,1,Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence.
17839,,1,The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.
17840,,1,Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast forward to today.
17841,,1,What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.Libya is in ruins.
17842,,1,Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead.
17843,,1,And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war.
17844,,1,ISIS controls large portions of territory.
17845,,1,"A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world."
17846,,1,Iraq is in chaos.
17847,,1,And ISIS is on the loose.
17848,,1,"ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.In 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations."
17849,,1,They were in seven nations.
17850,,1,"Terrible, but that's what it was.Today they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24."
17851,,1,And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries.
17852,,1,They don't even know.The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea.
17853,,1,A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is.
17854,,1,"It's bad.At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States."
17855,,1,"Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States."
17856,,1,"Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons."
17857,,1,"In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, ""death to America"", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour."
17858,,1,We all remember.
17859,,1,We all remember.
17860,,1,"[Booing] In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power."
17861,,1,He was describing us.He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors.
17862,,1,He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms.
17863,,1,"He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009."
17864,,1,"I remember it well.In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire."
17865,,1,"Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found."
17866,,1,"Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs."
17867,,1,The records are unbelievable and unmistakable.
17868,,1,His naive words were followed by even more naive actions.
17869,,1,The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question.
17870,,1,"The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya."
17871,,1,"President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made."
17872,,1,He considers it his worst mistake.
17873,,1,"According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor."
17874,,1,That's why we went in.
17875,,1,"With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage."
17876,,1,"Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country."
17877,,1,The Middle East in particular.
17878,,1,"The Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state."
17879,,1,It is unbelievable.
17880,,1,Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation.
17881,,1,"Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face."
17882,,1,"Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around."
17883,,1,It is now time for a new approach.
17884,,1,"Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure."
17885,,1,We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive.
17886,,1,I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning.
17887,,1,A major difference between me and my opponent.
17888,,1,"Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion."
17889,,1,"I was against, believe me.Three months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that ""perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet."
17890,,1,And that the economy is a much bigger problem.
17891,,1,"In August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview.
Here's the quote in full.
Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in."
17892,,1,"I would never have handled it that way."""
17893,,1,This was right after the invasion.
17894,,1,"Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country?
C'mon.
I then continued, ""Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over."
17895,,1,And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have.
17896,,1,"What was the purpose of this whole thing?
Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed.
And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs?
Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side.
The tremendous damage done.
All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces.
And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong.
All of this death and destruction for nothing.
So I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in."
17897,,1,But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.After we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies.
17898,,1,"They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date."
17899,,1,Who would do this but an incompetent president?Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated.
17900,,1,And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world.
17901,,1,"By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt."
17902,,1,One more point on this.
17903,,1,I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq.
17904,,1,I said it over and over and over again.
17905,,1,Another area where my judgment has been proven correct.
17906,,1,"I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil."
17907,,1,"According to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone."
17908,,1,That's before they really got started.
17909,,1,Fueling and funding its reign of terror.
17910,,1,"If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil."
17911,,1,I was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen.
17912,,1,"I said, ""Keep the oil."
17913,,1,Keep the oil.
17914,,1,Keep the oil.
17915,,1,"Don't let somebody else get it."""
17916,,1,If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war.
17917,,1,In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved.
17918,,1,This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets.
17919,,1,We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil.
17920,,1,"In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils."
17921,,1,"Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss."
17922,,1,But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course.
17923,,1,"If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end."
17924,,1,Thank you.
17925,,1,"Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam."
17926,,1,All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally.
17927,,1,Very important.
17928,,1,Some don't share this goal.
17929,,1,We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies.
17930,,1,"As president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal."
17931,,1,"We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel."
17932,,1,"We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished."
17933,,1,We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission.
17934,,1,I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism.
17935,,1,"Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats."
17936,,1,Very good.
17937,,1,"Very, very good.I also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS."
17938,,1,Wouldn't that be a good thing?
17939,,1,Wouldn't that be a good thing?
17940,,1,"They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours."
17941,,1,"They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.My administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS."
17942,,1,International cooperation to cut off their funding.
17943,,1,"Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting."
17944,,1,"Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records."
17945,,1,It's got to be stopped.
17946,,1,We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy.
17947,,1,"We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately."
17948,,1,"Unlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are."
17949,,1,"And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America."
17950,,1,I've often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens.
17951,,1,"Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt."
17952,,1,"Their enemy says, ""Thank you."
17953,,1,"The fight will not be limited to ISIS.
We will decimate Al- Qaeda.
And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.
So important.
We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions.
Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.But we must use ideological warfare as well.
Very important.
And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them.
But that will change.
Just as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam.
While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs.
Our administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices.
This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings.
Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year.
Recently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family.
In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions."""
17954,,1,"Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores."
17955,,1,"One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been ""too Westernized."""
17956,,1,To defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow.
17957,,1,It's a breeding ground.
17958,,1,"It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground."
17959,,1,A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well.
17960,,1,"The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants."
17961,,1,"Clearly, new screening procedures are needed."
17962,,1,"A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification."
17963,,1,"It's gotten worse, far worse."
17964,,1,"We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota."
17965,,1,"Beyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them."
17966,,1,"In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows."
17967,,1,"Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme."
17968,,1,We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people.
17969,,1,"In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test."
17970,,1,The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.
17971,,1,I call it extreme vetting.
17972,,1,I call it extreme--extreme vetting.
17973,,1,Our country has enough problems.
17974,,1,"We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before.  ]"
17975,,1,"In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law."
17976,,1,Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country.
17977,,1,"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas."
17978,,1,"To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us!"
17979,,1,Not for us.
17980,,1,Thank you.
17981,,1,Thank you.
17982,,1,"As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions."
17983,,1,"We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures."
17984,,1,The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening.
17985,,1,"We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year ."
17986,,1,"Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands ."
17987,,1,"If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening."
17988,,1,There's no way it can take place.
17989,,1,"By contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now."
17990,,1,"[Boos] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse!"
17991,,1,This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration.
17992,,1,Unbelievable numbers.
17993,,1,Unbelievable numbers.
17994,,1,"The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures."
17995,,1,Think of this  $400 billion.
17996,,1,"In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel."
17997,,1,[Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany.
17998,,1,"Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see."
17999,,1,It is a catastrophe.
18000,,1,We have enough problems in our country.
18001,,1,"We don't need more.Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures."
18002,,1,Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored.
18003,,1,The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications.
18004,,1,Almost every one of them.
18005,,1,"It said practically in big bold letters ""fraud""."
18006,,1,And nobody saw it.
18007,,1,"The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI."
18008,,1,Very sad.
18009,,1,"The female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said  she was here on a fiancйe visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online."
18010,,1,These are the people we're taking in.
18011,,1,"A neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling."
18012,,1,"Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded."
18013,,1,The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 .
18014,,1,"He, too, was interviewed by the FBI."
18015,,1,"His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech."
18016,,1,[Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say.
18017,,1,"It's called  weakness, weakness."
18018,,1,"It's called stupidity, and we've had it."
18019,,1,The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another.
18020,,1,"He even proclaimed that we ""love death more then you love life""."
18021,,1,Not good.
18022,,1,These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society.
18023,,1,Thank you.
18024,,1,Thank you.
18025,,1,"That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us."
18026,,1,We want to build bridges and erase divisions.
18027,,1,"The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization."
18028,,1,"This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners."
18029,,1,"And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials."
18030,,1,Thank you.
18031,,1,Thank you.
18032,,1,We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence.
18033,,1,"Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations."
18034,,1,Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions.
18035,,1,"Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism."
18036,,1,There will be consequences for those people.
18037,,1,There will be very serious consequences.
18038,,1,"Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country."
18039,,1,"To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission."
18040,,1,"The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary."
18041,,1,Immigration offices will also have their powers restored.
18042,,1,Those have been taken away.
18043,,1,"Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.To make America safe again, we must work together again."
18044,,1,Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus.
18045,,1,That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism.
18046,,1,"But just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing."
18047,,1,"We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties."
18048,,1,"We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now."
18049,,1,But this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life.
18050,,1,"We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life."
18051,,1,"But it's being tread on by sick, sick people."
18052,,1,"And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same."
18053,,1,"Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society."
18054,,1,"Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion."
18055,,1,"Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it."
18056,,1,Thank you.
18057,,1,Thank you.
18058,,1,"This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country."
18059,,1,"Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many."
18060,,1,We have a divider as president.
18061,,1,We call him the Great Divider.
18062,,1,It's the thing he best.
18063,,1,"It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart."
18064,,1,"This is my pledge to the American People  as your president, I will be your single greatest champion."
18065,,1,"I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally."
18066,,1,"We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People."
18067,,1,"Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone."
18068,,1,"Thank you very much, God bless you."
18069,,1,Thank you.
18070,,1,Thank you.
18071,,1,Thank you.
18072,,1,It's so great to be here tonight.
18073,,1,"I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani."
18074,,1,"We are at a decisive moment in this election.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country."
18075,,1,"Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism."
18076,,1,"Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness."
18077,,1,"Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.Law and order must be restored."
18078,,1,"It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods."
18079,,1,"It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct."
18080,,1,"Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one."
18081,,1,"The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police."
18082,,1,"You know it, and I know it.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded."
18083,,1,"More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?The war on our police must end."
18084,,1,"It must end now.The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor."
18085,,1,Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.
18086,,1,Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.
18087,,1,"Or the young child walking home from school.For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night."
18088,,1,"My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.I care too much about my country to let that happen.We all care too much about our country to let that happen.Good policing saves lives."
18089,,1,"My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this."
18090,,1,The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.
18091,,1,"Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?"
18092,,1,"I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.It's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force."
18093,,1,"I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.Hillary Clinton has had her chance."
18094,,1,She failed.
18095,,1,"Now it's time for new leadership.The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people."
18096,,1,"It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community."
18097,,1,"Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade."
18098,,1,"Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings."
18099,,1,18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.
18100,,1,The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.
18101,,1,Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.
18102,,1,Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.
18103,,1,"55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil."
18104,,1,"There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted."
18105,,1,They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it.
18106,,1,"It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.I'm not part of the corrupt system."
18107,,1,"In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me."
18108,,1,I've been paying my own way.
18109,,1,"The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.The other party the Democratic Party nominated the personification of special interest corruption."
18110,,1,"The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help."
18111,,1,"The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.Jobs."
18112,,1,Safety.
18113,,1,Opportunity.
18114,,1,"Fair and equal representation.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future."
18115,,1,"She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party."
18116,,1,"It's time to break with the failures of the past I want to offer Americans a new future.It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton."
18117,,1,"The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?"
18118,,1,It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.
18119,,1,It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.
18120,,1,It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.
18121,,1,"The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign."
18122,,1,Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.
18123,,1,Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.
18124,,1,"Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change."
18125,,1,I am fighting all of us across the country are fighting for peaceful regime change in our own country.
18126,,1,"The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.I am going to give the people their voice back.Think about it."
18127,,1,"The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?Are you ready for change?Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first?"
18128,,1,That puts your country first?
18129,,1,That puts your family first?Let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.
18130,,1,"It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests."
18131,,1,"I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system a lot of people who've created our problems will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.It's time to stop making the special interests rich."
18132,,1,"It's time to make the American people rich.I am going to Make America Wealthy again.The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.They've ruined the schools.They've driven out the jobs.They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.Violent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year."
18133,,1,Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.
18134,,1,Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore.
18135,,1,"They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton."
18136,,1,"More poverty, more crime, and more of the same."
18137,,1,"The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.It is time for a different future.Here is what I am proposing.First, on immigration."
18138,,1,No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community.
18139,,1,"Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans."
18140,,1,"I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community."
18141,,1,"We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee."
18142,,1,Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas.
18143,,1,"I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers."
18144,,1,"We are going to put students and parents first.Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success  a good education, and a good-paying job.On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods."
18145,,1,"To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say  your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases and give choice to patients and consumers."
18146,,1,"Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out as are many of the major insurance companies.On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government."
18147,,1,"We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense."
18148,,1,"We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information."
18149,,1,"No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government."
18150,,1,This is all just the beginning.We are going to make this a government of the people once again.
18151,,1,This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you.
18152,,1,"The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.These are tough times."
18153,,1,"But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.I will be your fighter.To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina."
18154,,1,Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina.
18155,,1,"She cannot win for you.Most importantly, she has bad judgment."
18156,,1,"Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.The only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors not the people.I've said it before, and I'll say it again."
18157,,1,My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge.
18158,,1,"Her pledge reads  ""I'm With Her""I choose to recite a different pledge."
18159,,1,"My pledge reads  ""I'm With You the American people."
18160,,1,"I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.
We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight  I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.
We are one nation.
When one state hurts, we all hurt and we must all work together to lift each other up.
Working, building, restoring together.Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences.
Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens.
If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end and it will end very quickly.Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people.
But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.We cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.Jobs, safety, opportunity.
Fair and equal representation.
This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.As you know, I am not a politician.
I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life.
I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.
I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.
Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.But one thing I can promise you is this  I will always tell you the truth.I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need and so many are not making it.
They are dying.I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them.
All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels.
The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people.
Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country.
This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives together to save our country.I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream.
Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved.
Let our children be dreamers too.Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.If something isn't working, you replace it.If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.That's why I am running  to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity.
A future where America, and its people, always and I mean always come first.Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises?
And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?That is all about to change and it's about to change soon.
We are going to put the American people first again.I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.In this journey, I will never lie to you.
I will never tell you something I do not believe.
I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.I have no special interest.
I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign nobody else is.My only interest is the American people.So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite  she never tells the truth.
One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?Has she apologized for Iraq?
For Libya?
For Syria?
Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran.
He denied it was for the hostages, but it was.
He said we don't pay ransom, but he did.
He lied about the hostages openly and blatantly just like he lied about Obamacare.Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped.
Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.Let's talk about the economy.
Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA.
Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it.
North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization another Hillary Clinton-backed deal.
Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State our chief diplomat with China.
She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.Another major issue in this campaign has been the border.
Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities.
So much needless suffering, so much preventable death.
I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border.
Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians.
They certainly don't get apologies.
They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.But they will always come first to me.Listen closely  we will deliver justice for all of these American Families.
We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.Please remember this  I will never put personal profit before national security.
I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests.
I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs.
I will never put the special interests before the national interest.
I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.Instead, I will be a champion for the people.The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives.
They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools.
Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders.
It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.So many people suffering in silence.
No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.So again, it's not about me.
It's never been about me.
It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice.I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again including some powerful people in my own party.
Because it means I am fighting for real change.There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.
Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for the insiders.I am fighting for you.Here is the change I propose.On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism.
I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens  we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed.
All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people.
Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa.
If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life.
Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.
Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration.
Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world.
We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one.
Their day is over.On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses creating millions of new good paying jobs.We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive.
We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones.
My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy.
She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities and what a big difference that will make.
This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina.
We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare at a much lower cost.On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.
No one will be above the law.I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.Finally, we are going to bring this country together.
We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans.
We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing.
Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working.
It is time for change.What do you have to lose by trying something new?
I will fix it.
This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted.
Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.This is the change I am promising all of you  an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track.
I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.It is time to vote for a New American Future.Together, We will make America strong again.We will make American proud again.We will make America safe again.Friends and fellow citizens  Come November, we will make America great again.Thank You, and God Bless.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What a crowd.
Wow, look at that.
Boy.
What a crowd.
[ ] Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We just set a record in this building, folks, so that's good news.
That's fantastic.
Thank you.
I love Michigan, and I must tell you, come November, to be specific, November 8th, with your help, we are going to win and we are going to win big.
And we are going to the White House and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to Michigan.
It's going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage-earner, the factory worker.
Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker.
They haven't had those victories for a long time.
A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years.
They're going to be heard again.
It'll be a win for the voters, not for the pundits, not for the journalists, not for the lobbyists, not for the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.
It's going to be your victory.
These are hard times for many in this country.
I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana.
Perhaps you can tell by the way I'm dressed.
Just got off the plane.
It was actually incredible.
The spirit of the people is incredible.
The devastation, likewise, they've never seen anything like it, but the spirit of the people is incredible.
And honestly, Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there.
We mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help, comfort and support to every last person in need.
To the people of Louisiana, we are with you and we will always be with you.
In my vision, I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength, courage and really unbeatable spirit.
Their spirit will overcome.
We have a lot to overcome in our country, especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and especially it's happening right here in Michigan.
It's an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country.
It's that strength that we're going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve.
In this new -- thank you.
Thank you very much.
In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force.
And if I'm not elected president, that will never happen, believe me.
They're talking to you, they're playing you, but believe me, you know the answer.
And I have to say that I've been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land, and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan.
Other people started talking about it last week.
They're not going to do anything about it.
Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.
Families strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.
Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice.
Government will become lean, effective, responsible and honest.
Our border will be protected and our children will be safe, very, very safe.
And we will build the wall, don't worry about it.
We will build the wall.
Law and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again.
American values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again.
But to achieve this new American future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past, and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over, and over again.
No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans no group.
No group.
If Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job.
It is a disgrace.
Tonight I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future.
The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years.
Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes.
It's time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities.
At what point do we say enough?
At what point do we say enough?
It is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again.
Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others, of Detroit.
40 percent of Detroit's residents, 40 percent, live in poverty.
Half of all Detroit residents do not work, and cannot work, and can't get a jobDetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime, number one.
This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city.
This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton.
33,000 e-mails gone.
The only way to change results is to change leadership.
We can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place.
A new future requires brand new leadership.
Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control.
To those I say the following, what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump?
What do you have to lose?
I say it again, what do you have to lose?
Look, you're living in poverty.
Your schools are no good.
You have no jobs.
58% of your youth is unemployed.
What the hell do you have to lose?And at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote.
I promise you.
Because I will produce, I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans.
And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote.
That's all they've done.
And once the election is over, they go back to their palaces in Washington.
And you know what?
They do nothing for you.
Just remember it.So, you have nothing to lose.
One thing we know for sure  if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results.
My administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before.We will work.
We will bring back jobs.
We will work.By contrast, the one thing every item in Hillary Clinton's agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers.It takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan.
Your companies are leaving every single state in our union.
They're going to Mexico.
They're going everywhere but here.
Hillary Clinton supports open borders.
Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs.Whether you like it or don't like it.
They take your jobs.
Her fierce opposition to school choice.
You need choice.
You have to get your children into good schools.
You do that through competition.
You need choice.
Her plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone.
$1.3 trillion tax increase.
Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.
Her tremendous opposition to American energy.
Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries.
America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.
Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit, who have become refugees in their own country.
It's time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort.
To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve.Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country.
According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee.Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel.
By the way, for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States, we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or let's say Syria.
The approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless, billions of dollars.
It's called extreme vetting.
Extreme vetting.
We will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth.
The African American community has given so much to this country.
They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.
They've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights.
They've sacrificed so much for the national good.
Yet, nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58%, as I said, of African Americans are not working.
They cannot find a job.We must do better as a country.
I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past.
It won't be.
Our future will be a great future for everyone.
For everyone.
In a Trump administration, all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time.I want higher wages for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for all Americans.
We want higher wages  Many, many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.
They're working two jobs instead of one.
They're working much harder as they get older and it's supposed to be the opposite.We're gonna stop it.
We're going to create great jobs and we're gonna get the wages up.
Hillary Clinton, is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain.
Promises, promises, all talk no action.
All talk, no action politicians.
They talk, talk, talk.
You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.
With Trump, that is not going to happen.
Believe me.
We must turn the page on yesterday, only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes.
And we can't take, as a country, four more years of Obama.
And that's what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.
In this new American future, American workers will always come first.
America first, always come first.
This will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector.
Now, you have to understand, the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster.
Is a disaster.Look at your notes, look at your stats, look at what's happening to your state.
You're losing your businesses.
It's like taking candy away from a baby.
And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs, you're gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and you're not going to have your job for very long.And if Trump gets in, those days are over folks, they're over  We will be brining back our jobs to Michigan.
There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land, go someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with no retribution.It won't happen.
There will be consequence.
Won't happen.
It will not happen.
Michigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.
As you know, NAFTA, one of the worst trade bills in history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world.
Not only in our country.
Its emptied out Michigan, its emptied out New England.
Its emptied out New York State.
Its emptied out so many of our great companies.They leave and they fire.
We end up with devastation.
We end up with unemployment.
We end up with nothing.The bill was signed by Bill Clinton.
It was supported by Hillary Clinton.
Right here in this community, you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization.
Another Hillary Clinton back deal.
She backs all the deals.And by the way, she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership.
TPP.
If she is elected.
Just mark your words.
Just remember, you know it's gonna happen.She considered it the gold standard.
All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it, she said I can't win this one"" so she went against it."
18161,,1,"She will go back immediately, and you saw that when the governor of Virginia, who's her friend, said that was going to happen.Detroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements."
18162,,1,"That was supported very strongly by my opponent.No industry, has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry."
18163,,1,It has been a total disaster.
18164,,1,"According to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan."
18165,,1,"Today, that number is down to only 160,000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye."
18166,,1,But not me.
18167,,1,Not with me.
18168,,1,It won't happen.
18169,,1,"In 2014, General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018."
18170,,1,Not good.
18171,,1,"In April 2016, Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico."
18172,,1,"Mexico will become the car capital of the world very, very quickly."
18173,,1,And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president.
18174,,1,"In which case, it's not gonna happen."
18175,,1,"In same month, Fiat Chrysler announced 1,300 layoffs."
18176,,1,The list goes on and on.
18177,,1,"We will turn it around, we will turn it around fast."
18178,,1,"We will meet with these companies and we will say, it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border, and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in, okay?"
18179,,1,"And when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places, number one, they're not going to move in the first place, and number two, if they do, our country will make one heck of a lot of money."
18180,,1,"But to save your jobs and do all of the things that I'm talking about, we have to win on November 8th."
18181,,1,The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved.
18182,,1,"It will be almost, nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA."
18183,,1,"We know from Hillary's closest friend, that she is planning to ram through TPP if she's elected."
18184,,1,"She even called it, as I said, the gold standard."
18185,,1,"Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan, in particular, for the car industry in particular, for the people of Michigan."
18186,,1,I won't let it happen.
18187,,1,"According to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015."
18188,,1,"By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think of that 740,000 manufacturing jobs."
18189,,1,Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.
18190,,1,Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP.
18191,,1,It will not be pretty.
18192,,1,"That's why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen."
18193,,1,"I have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available on my website."
18194,,1,"It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods, of which many of them do."
18195,,1,My plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back.
18196,,1,"And if we can't make a much, much better deal than we have right now, we will walk."
18197,,1,"I'm not in any way, shape or form an isolationist."
18198,,1,"I don't believe in it, but we have to make great deals for our country."
18199,,1,We're losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year.
18200,,1,That's our trade deficit.
18201,,1,Who negotiates these deals?
18202,,1,We want great trade deals and we will have them.
18203,,1,"But we want trade deals that work for America, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the American worker."
18204,,1,We want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit.
18205,,1,"We don't want to expand it, and it's been expanding for years."
18206,,1,For years and years.
18207,,1,"You look at the charts up, up, up, up, up."
18208,,1,"And I say to myself so often, why don't they do something about it?"
18209,,1,And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.
18210,,1,We have politicians as our negotiators.
18211,,1,"We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won't let her do what's right for our workers and for our country."
18212,,1,"We want to be leading the world in production, exports and manufacturing."
18213,,1,We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change.
18214,,1,Another major issue in this race is foreign policy.
18215,,1,Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another.
18216,,1,"Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq, and I opposed it so strongly."
18217,,1,Nobody cared.
18218,,1,"I was a civilian, but I opposed it."
18219,,1,I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East.
18220,,1,It was such common sense and look what happened.
18221,,1,Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history.
18222,,1,But she is totally without remorse.
18223,,1,Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world.
18224,,1,But has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused?
18225,,1,No.Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.
18226,,1,"Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence."
18227,,1,Libya was somewhat stable.
18228,,1,Syria was under control.
18229,,1,"The group we now know today, ISIS, was close to being extinguished."
18230,,1,Iran was being choked by sanctions.
18231,,1,"Now, take a look at what we have."
18232,,1,"Fast forward to the present time.After Hillary, here is what it looks like."
18233,,1,Iraq is in total chaos.
18234,,1,Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war.
18235,,1,"A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, where we're taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people."
18236,,1,ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.
18237,,1,"Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash  Very much like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, Obamacare a total disaster."
18238,,1,It will be repealed.
18239,,1,It will be replaced.
18240,,1,"Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction, and terrorism."
18241,,1,"America deserves a better legacy.All of you deserve a much, much, better future.I am the change agent."
18242,,1,I am the change agent.
18243,,1,I am your messenger.
18244,,1,"And I said it many times, I'm nothing more than your messenger."
18245,,1,"It's a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great health care, get rid of Obamacare, save our Second Amendment."
18246,,1,Which is under tremendous siege right now.Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have.
18247,,1,"While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time."
18248,,1,Our country was losing.
18249,,1,"Our people were losing, but she is cashing in."
18250,,1,Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State.
18251,,1,"He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure, an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years."
18252,,1,"By the way, things came out today that blow everything away today."
18253,,1,Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.
18254,,1,It was pay for play.
18255,,1,"Yet, Hillary Clinton, who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused, has no remorse at all."
18256,,1,She offers no apologies.
18257,,1,No apologies for unleashing ISIS.
18258,,1,No apologies for her open borders.
18259,,1,No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi.
18260,,1,"The only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 e-mails that she deleted."
18261,,1,"And the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big, big, big."
18262,,1,And I will bring your jobs back.
18263,,1,So are you ready to vote?And what about your future?
18264,,1,"Is it going to be great, good, or terrible?Great."
18265,,1,"So if you're ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve, a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service."
18266,,1,"Remember, I'm funding my campaign, I'm spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office."
18267,,1,"I'm raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, which I think is doing a very good job, but I'll tell you more about that on November 8th."
18268,,1,I'll let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job.
18269,,1,But I think they're going to do a great job.
18270,,1,No one will be above the law in a Trump administration.
18271,,1,"The State Department will work for the country, not for Hillary Clinton's donors."
18272,,1,And I will work for you and I will work for no one else.
18273,,1,I will work for you.
18274,,1,I will never lie to you.
18275,,1,"I will never put any other interests before you and I will never, ever stop fighting for you."
18276,,1,Never.
18277,,1,The government will work for the people again.
18278,,1,That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and we're not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place.
18279,,1,"We are going to make sure that we have total screening, and without it, we cannot continue to have our government run like this."
18280,,1,We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS.
18281,,1,"At home, taxes will go down, especially for look, I mean, it's going to go down for a lot of people, for business they're going down, businesses are going to flourish, they're going to come pouring back."
18282,,1,"But taxes will go down, especially for middle-income Americans."
18283,,1,And small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods.
18284,,1,"As I said, Obamacare will be repealed and replaced."
18285,,1,"Voters, not special interests, will be in charge finally."
18286,,1,We are going to bring our country together again.
18287,,1,We have a divided country.
18288,,1,It's totally divided.
18289,,1,"The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity."
18290,,1,We will love each other.
18291,,1,We will have one county.
18292,,1,Everybody will work together.
18293,,1,We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans.
18294,,1,It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.
18295,,1,"In my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally."
18296,,1,We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
18297,,1,"This is the change I am promising to all of you; an honest government with low taxes, a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American."
18298,,1,It's time to vote for a new American future.
18299,,1,"Together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America united again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again."
18300,,1,God bless you.
18301,,1,Thank you.
18302,,1,"Thank you very much, Michigan."
18303,,1,Thank you.
18304,,1,"On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders."
18305,,1,"We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.It's going to be America First from now on.Let me tell you what this new future looks like.We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.That's the issue of crime."
18306,,1,Violent crime is rising across the country.
18307,,1,"More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.No American should consider this level of crime acceptable."
18308,,1,Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers.
18309,,1,"This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas."
18310,,1,"We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.To all law enforcement in America  we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.All citizens deserve to be protected."
18311,,1,"No American left behind.I want every African-American parent in this country and all parents in this country to be able to raise their kids in safety.And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country and all children in this country are put on the American ladder of success  a good education, and a good-paying job.We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers."
18312,,1,"My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.No one owns me."
18313,,1,"I answer only to the American people.In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities."
18314,,1,"Murdock confirms these facts ""The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent   down 3.2 percent.This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent   down 6.4 percent.The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014   up 1.6 percent.The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama   from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014   up 58.2 percent.Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports   down 9.5 percent."
18315,,1,"Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty.
58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore.
Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.To those suffering I say  what do you have to lose by trying something new?Let me also tell you what you have to gain  more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.We are going to turn it all around.
Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.That is how we are going to create a New American Future.But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all  Border Security.We are going to build a wall.We are going to enforce the law.We are going to protect your jobs and wages.And we are going to keep our country safe.According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016.
Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.She wants catch-and-release.Obamacare for illegal immigrants.Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.She wants to gut immigration enforcement.She supports Sanctuary Cities.She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.One lawless order after another.We must not let it happen.Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.
There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando.
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.I want to create safe zones in the Middle East.
My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values.
After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.This election will decide whether or not we have a border.This election will decide whether or not we have a country.Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports.
Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.These are all forgotten Americans they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy.
Every day more and more alarming facts come out.The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself.
This is what happens in a Third World country it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes.
That's why she deleted 33,000 emails.
That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.She said she never sent or received classified materials.That was a lie, proved over and over again.She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device.
But she used multiple devices.Another lie.Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails.
But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.Another Clinton lie.She said she sent nothing marked classified.A total lie, unmasked to the world.
And more to come.She said her server was secure, and had no breaches.
But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.More Clinton lies.Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.One more Hillary Clinton lie.Lie after lie after lie.Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins.
It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office.
They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business or, more accurately, their crime enterprise grew with the roles reversed.
Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President.
They turned this into an exponentially larger business.But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise.
It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same.
If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State.
Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills.
She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff.
You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business.
But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case.
In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech.
I walked through two of them yesterday the sale of U.S.
Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.The UBS saga is another one.
Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement.
Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts.
Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation.
After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.This is corruption, pure and simple.This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.Justice is supposed to be blind.
It's never supposed to be for sale.In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country  elect Donald J. Trump.Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law.
Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty.
Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama.
The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation.
I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.The era of division is coming to end.
We will create a new future of American unity.Are you ready for real American change?It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.We will promote our common culture, values and principles.We will be one nation.We will be one people.We will share together one great future.It's going to be America First.Together, we will make America proud again.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.Friends, citizens and fellow Americans  We will make America great again.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[ ] Senator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much.Wow, what a group!
What a group!Very excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight.
Thank you very much.
The people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word energy,"" unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks."
18316,,1,Thank you very much.
18317,,1,And thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning.
18318,,1,"I will not forget it, Mississippi."
18319,,1,"We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning."
18320,,1,This is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent.
18321,,1,And this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future.
18322,,1,"To everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th."
18323,,1,"This is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people."
18324,,1,No one will be left behind anymore.
18325,,1,"I'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan."
18326,,1,They are going through a lot.
18327,,1,We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism!
18328,,1,Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country.
18329,,1,Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence.
18330,,1,Our jobs have moved to other countries.
18331,,1,Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores.
18332,,1,"And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security."
18333,,1,The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union.
18334,,1,This is the movement known as Brexit.
18335,,1,"On June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks  From their international government which hasn't worked."
18336,,1,They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders.
18337,,1,"They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government."
18338,,1,Working people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny.
18339,,1,"The people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change."
18340,,1,The same thing is happening right here in the United States.
18341,,1,It's happening.
18342,,1,All the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change.
18343,,1,"They want you to believe things can't be changed.And they can so easily, so easily and so smartly.And we all know things have to change."
18344,,1,We have no choice.
18345,,1,And they have to change right now.
18346,,1,"Before the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it."
18347,,1,"People said, what does he know, what does he know?"
18348,,1,And guess what?
18349,,1,"I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th."
18350,,1,"Hillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks."
18351,,1,"She got this one wrong, too.She got this one wrong, too, folks."
18352,,1,"She got this one wrong, too."
18353,,1,She gets them all wrong.
18354,,1,"She gets them all wrong, doesn't she?"
18355,,1,"She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you."
18356,,1,"And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want."
18357,,1,She wants a country without borders.
18358,,1,She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations.
18359,,1,She wants a government that ignores the will of the people.
18360,,1,"She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash."
18361,,1,"It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.According to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors."
18362,,1,Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first.
18363,,1,We believe in America first.
18364,,1,Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists.
18365,,1,She will never straighten out our country.
18366,,1,"She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country."
18367,,1,We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want.
18368,,1,She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic.
18369,,1,"The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States  Not illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that."
18370,,1,My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country.
18371,,1,I will fight for their security.
18372,,1,I will fight for their jobs.
18373,,1,"We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries."
18374,,1,We will not let it happen anymore.
18375,,1,"We'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you."
18376,,1,It ends.
18377,,1,What's been going on ends on November 8th.
18378,,1,"We will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together."
18379,,1,Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people.
18380,,1,November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence.
18381,,1,This is a great honor for me.
18382,,1,"I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles."
18383,,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage."
18384,,1,"Well, Thank you very much Good evening Mississippi.
I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism.
It's a message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals.
And we did it.
We made June the 23rd our independence day.
When we smashed the establishment.
And we did it.
Everybody said we would lose but what did we see?
We saw experts from all over the world.
We saw the international monetary fund.
We saw Moody's.
We saw Standard and Poor's.
We saw global leaders project fear.
Telling us that if we voted not to be run by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels.
Yeah, well it's okay, they don't like me either so it doesn't really matter does it?
But they told us our economy would fall off of a cliff.
They told us there'd be mass unemployment.
They told us that investment would leave our country.
And David Cameron, then our Prime Minister, but no longer, told us that we might even get World War III.
And we saw the comentariate and we saw the polling industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign.
On the day of the vote itself, that morning, they put us ten points behind.
And actually, they were all wrong.
And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who've been let down by modern global corporatism.
We reached those people.
We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believe by going out and voting for Brexit they can take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self respect.
Now, the big card, the big card the Prime Minister decided to play in the referendum was he got a foreign visitor to come to London.
to talk to us.
Yes, we were visited by one Barack Obama.
And he talked down to us.
He treated us as if we were nothing.
One of the oldest functioning democracies in the world.
And here he was told us to vote remain.
So I, having criticized, having criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election, but, but, you know I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I'm hearing you, but I will say this, if I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.
In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.
Folks, the message is clear.
The parallels are there.
There are millions of ordinary Americans who have been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process.
And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
You can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington.
And you'll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.
We had our own people's army of ordinary citizens who went out and delivered leaflets, who went to meet people where they worked and where they socialized, who convinced and inspired people to go out if this was the one and only time in their life, and to vote for change.
So my advice to you, if you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots on, you better get out there campaigning and remember, and remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.
Thank you very much, indeed.Wow!"
18385,,1,"Thank you, Nigel.What a job!"
18386,,1,What a job he did.
18387,,1,"What a job he did against all odds.Thank you, Nigel.That was some job that he did against all odds."
18388,,1,Everybody said it couldn't be done.
18389,,1,"And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here."
18390,,1,Thank you.
18391,,1,"And if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today."
18392,,1,"I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good."
18393,,1,We're leading in a lot of locations.
18394,,1,"Thank you.It's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny."
18395,,1,Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people.
18396,,1,"They have, they have totally lost touch."
18397,,1,"You need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law."
18398,,1,We can't allow that.
18399,,1,"Why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families?"
18400,,1,Devastated.
18401,,1,"jobs, wages and security for Americans."
18402,,1,And the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests.
18403,,1,"First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens."
18404,,1,"We have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as ""Obamacare"" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs."
18405,,1,"Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen.Second, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens."
18406,,1,"Third, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens."
18407,,1,"The quality of life, our quality of life is going down.Our level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago.Hillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly."
18408,,1,Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents.
18409,,1,"Her support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root."
18410,,1,"Yesterday I met with her mom, Michelle."
18411,,1,Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally.
18412,,1,I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports.
18413,,1,Where is the sanctuary for American children?
18414,,1,Where is that sanctuary?
18415,,1,The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans.
18416,,1,Why aren't young Americans dreamers also?
18417,,1,I want my dreamers to be young Americans.
18418,,1,"Hillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term  A large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life.I only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America."
18419,,1,"Importantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people."
18420,,1,"We are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as ""Obamacare."""
18421,,1,"We are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs!"
18422,,1,"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me."
18423,,1,"So we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes."
18424,,1,"Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me."
18425,,1,"Rising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form."
18426,,1,"We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton."
18427,,1,We're going to stand up to China on trade.
18428,,1,"We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP."
18429,,1,It will not happen with me.
18430,,1,"It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me.This state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton."
18431,,1,"Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country."
18432,,1,"We are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi  And in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land."
18433,,1,We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away.
18434,,1,Thank you.
18435,,1,"Thank you.And I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities."
18436,,1,The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.
18437,,1,"Democratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before."
18438,,1,Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty.
18439,,1,Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.
18440,,1,"More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone."
18441,,1,"Violent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up."
18442,,1,"Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore."
18443,,1,"The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return."
18444,,1,"They've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it.It's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes."
18445,,1,It's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly.
18446,,1,It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.
18447,,1,"And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system."
18448,,1,"To those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new?"
18449,,1,What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president?
18450,,1,What do you have to lose?
18451,,1,I will fix the problem.
18452,,1,I will fix the problem.
18453,,1,"If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results.But I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right?"
18454,,1,Right?
18455,,1,What do you have to gain?
18456,,1,We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive.
18457,,1,What else will we gain?
18458,,1,We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need.
18459,,1,We will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity.
18460,,1,And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that.
18461,,1,We will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before.
18462,,1,We will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs.
18463,,1,"And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor."
18464,,1,"Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color  only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future."
18465,,1,She's going to do nothing for African Americans.
18466,,1,She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics.
18467,,1,"She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors."
18468,,1,These are the people she cares about.
18469,,1,She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities.
18470,,1,She doesn't care.
18471,,1,Remember this.
18472,,1,"You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years."
18473,,1,"And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child."
18474,,1,"We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it."
18475,,1,Hillary Clinton has no remorse.
18476,,1,I will fight to create a better future for every American.
18477,,1,The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.
18478,,1,"Of course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that."
18479,,1,They're going to have to start studying those polls.
18480,,1,"That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote."
18481,,1,"That is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it."
18482,,1,Another crucial issue in this race is national security.
18483,,1,Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office.
18484,,1,"Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over."
18485,,1,Libya was stable.
18486,,1,Syria was under control.
18487,,1,Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence.
18488,,1,"The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened."
18489,,1,Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.
18490,,1,Fast forward to today.
18491,,1,"After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced?"
18492,,1,Libya is in ruins.
18493,,1,Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead.
18494,,1,"And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world Syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war."
18495,,1,"ISIS controls large portions of the territory.A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from."
18496,,1,We know nothing.Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose.ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west.
18497,,1,"At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States."
18498,,1,"Iran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom  That President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong."
18499,,1,He lied.
18500,,1,He lied.
18501,,1,"Just like he said Obamacare, ""keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor,"" 28 times, ""keep your plan, keep your doctor."""
18502,,1,"And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster."
18503,,1,"Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons."
18504,,1,"In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants ""death to America"" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power."
18505,,1,And we put them there over the last three years!
18506,,1,"This is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  death, destruction, terrorism and weakness."
18507,,1,But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
18508,,1,"We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS."
18509,,1,We have no choice destroying ISIS.
18510,,1,"We will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States  We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win!"
18511,,1,Thank you.
18512,,1,"Thank you.This is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare."
18513,,1,It's also an ideological fight.
18514,,1,"We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government."
18515,,1,"Only by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again  A country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity."
18516,,1,The future is limitless.
18517,,1,All we have to do is believe in America once again.
18518,,1,We have to believe it can happen.
18519,,1,It can happen.
18520,,1,We will put back our faith in America's special destiny.
18521,,1,We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government.
18522,,1,We'll create a level playing field for American workers.
18523,,1,We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again.
18524,,1,We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.
18525,,1,"I am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country."
18526,,1,I am the change candidate.
18527,,1,"This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before."
18528,,1,I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.
18529,,1,I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.And I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods.
18530,,1,I'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children.
18531,,1,"And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight  I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win."
18532,,1,"Together we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again.Thank you and God bless you."
18533,,1,"Thank you, Mississippi."
18534,,1,We love Mississippi.
18535,,1,God bless you.
18536,,1,Thank you.
18537,,1,Thank you.
18538,,1,I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.
18539,,1,"Together, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people."
18540,,1,"A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard.It will be a win for the voters not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.This is going to be YOUR victory.We are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.Government will become lean, effective, responsible and honest.Our border will be protected, and our children will be safe.We will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.But to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life now and throughout our history should be celebrated and cherished."
18541,,1,"This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else."
18542,,1,"This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans.There is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.Tonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.These Democratic policies the policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six."
18543,,1,58% of African-American youth are not working.
18544,,1,"Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.In Detroit, half of all its residents do not work."
18545,,1,"In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.Here, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years."
18546,,1,"More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.It breaks our hearts.We cannot let this violence continue."
18547,,1,"It must be ended.Under A Trump Administration, it will be ended.It will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear."
18548,,1,"I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.There is one thing which can no longer be denied  if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results."
18549,,1,"To those suffering, I say  what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump?"
18550,,1,I will fix it.
18551,,1,"I will fight for you as no one ever has before.Let me also tell you what you have to gain  jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.This means so much to me.I believe every child in this country in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.In the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.The article is called  ""Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump."""
18552,,1,"McDonald writes that ""Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted."
18553,,1,"Freedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.
So too is the issue of school choice.We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.I will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream.
Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines.
We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.Remember  the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity.
It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party.Our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.Once again, we will be One American Nation.One United People.And we will have One Great Future.That great future will be built on these three critical words  jobs, jobs, jobs.This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies.We are bringing the jobs back to our country.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.That would be a disaster.
We won't let it happen.But that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.On taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%.
Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.On regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed.
We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.Economic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster.
Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy.
This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.We are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in.
The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years.
We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.Another major issue in this race is foreign policy.
Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.Her tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.Pre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.Libya was stable.Syria was under control.The group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.Iran was being choked by sanctions.Now, fast-forward to present time.After Hillary, here is what the world looks like Iraq is in total chaos.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.ISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.Iran the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton  death, destruction and terrorism.America deserves a better legacy.All of you deserve a better future.
I am the change agent.Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time.
Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.Then there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.It was pay-for-play.
Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails.
But we know that is one more Clinton lie.
The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.Now, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over these were emails about Benghazi.It just never ends with the Clintons.There is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th and to vote big.In A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country not for Hillary Clinton's donors.Under Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful.Politicians defending politicians.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.The government will work for citizens once again.The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common.
We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.This is the change I am promising all of you  an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless.
Wow.
Thank you.
That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.
Thank you very much.Thank you, Phoenix.
I am so glad to be back in Arizona.The state that has a very, very special place in my heart.
I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.Now, you know this is where it all began for me.
Remember that massive crowd also.
So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight.
We're going to Arizona, OK?This will be a little bit different.
This won't be a rally speech, per se.
Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much.
And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States.
It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile.
And, in the end we're all going to win.
Both countries, we're all going to win.This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations.
And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship.
We want fairness.But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.Sadly, sadly there is no other way.
The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized.
But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them.
The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune.
That's the way it is.Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth.
The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians.
It's all you can do.
Thank you.
Thank you.Let me tell you who it does not serve.
It does not serve you the American people.
Doesn't serve you.
When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages.
Immigration reform should mean something else entirely.
It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.Thank you.
But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues.
For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over.
We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.
Sometimes it's just not going to work out.
It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.Then there is the issue of security.
Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced.
I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders.
So many people, so many, many people.
So sad.
They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root.
The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Weak, weak policies.
Weak and foolish policies.He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large.
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona.
A lot of you have known about Grant.
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.Another victim is Kate Steinle.
Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times.
And they knew he was no good.Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless.
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal.
And they knew it was going to happen.In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.And this is what we get.
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.But these facts are never reported.
Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally.
In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.Not going to happen anymore, folks.
November 8th.
Not going to happen anymore.The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years.
It's always 11 million.Our government has no idea.
It could be 3 million.
It could be 30 million.
They have no idea what the number is.Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue.
It will never be a central issue.
It doesn't matter from that standpoint.
Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status.
And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today.
There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.Nothing even comes a close second.
Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law.
We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity.
So important.We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.Thank you.President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona.
You know it.President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities.
They support catch and release on the border.
they support visa overstays.
They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention.
And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country.
Our citizens.Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from.
I always say Trojan Horse.
Watch what's going to happen, folks.
It's not going to be pretty.This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.
And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria.
What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that.
What the hell are we doing?Hard to believe.
Hard to believe.
Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that.
They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire.
It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people.
Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years.
And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies.
So important.Number one, are you ready?
Are you ready?We will build a great wall along the southern border.
And Mexico will pay for the wall.One hundred percent.
They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.
And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall.
On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels.
Remember that, above and below.Above and below ground sensors.
Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us.
I really believe it.
Mexico will work with us.
I absolutely believe it.
And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today.
I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.Number two, we are going to end catch and release.
We catch them, oh go ahead.
We catch them, go ahead.Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.And they'll be brought great distances.
We're not dropping them right across.
They learned that.
President Eisenhower.
They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back.
And across.Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end.
We will take them great distances.
But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?Number three.
Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great.
It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it.
Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.
Zero.
Zero.Zero.
They don't come in here.
They don't come in here.According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens.
We will begin moving them out day one.
As soon as I take office.
Day one.
In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police.
Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve.
I can tell you.
They're great people.
But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.They live with these people.
They get mocked by these people.
They can't do anything about these people, and they want to.
They know who these people are.
Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.And you can call it deported if you want.
The press doesn't like that term.
You can call it whatever the hell you want.
They're gone.Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country.
The crime will stop.
They're going to be gone.
It will be over.They're going out.
They're going out fast.Moving forward.
We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.That's over.
That's over, folks.
That's over.Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities.
These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately.
We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program.
Good program.
We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration.
And those were programs that worked.This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.
There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders.
None, none, none.Here's an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.
Strong.And then we get them out.Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed.
And they will go face, believe me.
They're going to go.We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?Maybe they'll be able to deport her.The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast.
And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore.
There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good.
We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them.
What they do is incredible.And getting their endorsement means so much to me.
More to me really than I can say.
Means so much.
First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities.
We block the funding.
No more funds.We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths.
Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally?
So unfair.Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court.
Great.Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.
And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States.
Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8.
And don't forget your Second Amendment.
And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.And don't forget building up our depleted military.
And don't forget taking care of our vets.
Don't forget our vets.
They have been forgotten.Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before.
In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office.
And you see what bad judgment she has.
She has seriously bad judgment.Can you imagine?
In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced.
As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities.
But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.
And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.
That is what it means to have laws and to have a country.
Otherwise we don't have a country.Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges.
That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States.
And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.Our country is a mess.
We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks.
Our country has to straighten out.
And we have to straighten out fast.The number is likely higher.
But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress.
As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.I call it extreme vetting right?
Extreme vetting.
I want extreme.
It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good.
It's extreme.And if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks.
Got to have a country.
Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.
And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are, where they come from.
There's no documentation.
There's no paperwork.
It's going to end badly folks.
It's going to end very, very badly.For the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.
Which I agree with 100 percent.
We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states.
We don't want to put up the money.
We owe almost $20 trillion.
Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.But we will get the money from Gulf states and others.
We'll supervise it.
We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.Another reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people.
And we will get the right people.
An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.Thank you.
We're very proud of our country.
Aren't we?
Really?
With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country.
For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan.
And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.
That's what they say.That's what they say.
They're justified.
Right?
And we're admitting them to our country.
Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities.
Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure.
And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks.
Hopefully, none.Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States.
Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back.
So we say, OK, we'll keep them.
Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific.
There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year.
Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.
And, they would comply if we would act properly.In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries.
Instead we have them all over the place.
Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back.
Hard to believe with the power we have.
Hard to believe.We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up.
You ever see that?
The big bully that keeps getting beat up.These 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch.
She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.And, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.
(APPLAUSE)Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation.
We take them, we take them.Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.
For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed.
The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens.
Never happens.Hillary Clinton, all talk.
Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision.
You ever notice?
In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place.
And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air.
We will have a proper tracking system.Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left.
Why should the?
Nobody's telling them to leave.
Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security.
The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.And, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant.
Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right?
What that could have meant?Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas.
Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out.
It exists to protect all aspects of American life.
The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.That is why immigration limits are established in the first place.
If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.
We will enforce all of our immigration laws.And the same goes for government benefits.
The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country.
Tremendous costs.
This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury.
Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people.
Workers.
We're going to take care of our workers.And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals.
We're going to renegotiate trade deals.
We're going to bring our jobs back home.
We're going to bring our jobs back home.We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA.
And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.We're going to bring our jobs back home.
And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them.
It's not going to be so easy.
There will be consequence.
Remember that.
There will be consequence.
They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment.
It's not going to happen.
There will be consequences.We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.
Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country.
So true.
But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.We've had some big waves.
And tremendously positive things have happened.
Incredible things have happened.
To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works.
Assimilation, an important word.
Integration and upward mobility.Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.
The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms.
To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.We take anybody.
Come on in, anybody.
Just come on in.
Not anymore.You know, folks, it's called a two-way street.
It is a two-way street, right?
We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others.
Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first.
Remember that.To choose immigrants based on merit.
Merit, skill, and proficiency.
Doesn't that sound nice?
And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.
And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker.
She's going to do nothing.
Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth.
And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years.
That's what it is.She is going to do nothing.
And just look at the past.
She's done nothing.
She's been there for 35 years.
She's done nothing.
And I say what do you have to lose?
Choose me.
Watch how good we're going to do together.
Watch.You watch.
We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.
We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago.
They're decades and decades old.To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date.
They're archaic.
They're ancient.
We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?So let's now talk about the big picture.
These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years.
It's going to happen, folks.
Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you.
I write those checks.
Nobody owns Trump.I will get this done for you and for your family.
We'll do it right.
You'll be proud of our country again.
We'll do it right.
We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above.
And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail.
Crime will go down.
Border crossings will plummet.
Gangs will disappear.And the gangs are all over the place.
And welfare use will decrease.
We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities.
We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only.
To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above.
Those who have left to seek entry --Thank you.
Thank you.
Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.
We will break the cycle.
There will be no amnesty.Our message to the world will be this.
You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country.
Can't do it.This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly.
People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized.
It's not going to work that way.
Those days are over.Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time.
And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before.
All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security.
That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security.
Cut it off.Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing.
And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.
And do you notice, she doesn't answer.She didn't go to Louisiana.
She didn't go to Mexico.
She was invited.She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again.
Believe me.What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement.
Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton.
You won't like what you're hearing.The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness.
That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better.
I really believe this is it.
This is our last time.
November 8.
November 8.
You got to get out and vote on November 8.It's our last chance.
It's our last chance.
And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment.
Remember that.So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know.
I'm going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.
These are amazing women.These are amazing people.
(Family members speak individually.
)Thank you.These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that.
I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group.
But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it.
Let's give them a really tremendous hand.That's tough stuff, I will tell you.
That is tough stuff.
Incredible people.So, now is the time for these voices to be heard.
Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem.
It can be fixed quickly.
Let's our secure our border.Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country.
Let's protect our social security and Medicare.
Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.This has been an incredible evening.
We're going to remember this evening.
November 8, we have to get everybody.
This is such an important state.
November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.We're going to bring -- thank you, thank you.
We're going to take our country back, folks.
This is a movement.
We're going to take our country back.Thank you.Thank you.This is an incredible movement.
The world is talking about it.
The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking.
You should start looking.Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.
Together we can save America itself.
Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.Thank you.
I love you.
God bless you, everybody.
God bless you.
God bless you, thank you.
Thank you all so much.
What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.
I thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers.
You have all done such an incredible job.The men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America.
Strength, courage, selfless devotion.
Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism not Globalism.We are in your debt.I will never let you down.Together, we are going to work on so many shared goals.
But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you  promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children.
We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.We will be united by our common culture, values and principles becoming One American Nation.One country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.The flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.We will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.
We will do it based on those three famous words  Peace Through Strength.We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.I've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website.
Here are the basics I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.We are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.The Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust.
But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.That means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice whatever is fastest and best for the veteran.
The Veteran will be in control.Should I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again.
We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security and our border.I just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country including to our Armed Services.I want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.We also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere.
A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.When I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers.
We will fight for every last American job.We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.We are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores and unleash an American Energy Revolution.We will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies.
We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism.
We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.At the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country.
That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees.
My opponent wants a 550% increase.
I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas and use the money saved to invest in America.It is time to create a New American Future for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.In this future, we will have an honest government and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play.
Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country including our inner cities.
We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success  a good education, and a great job.We will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote.
Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.We will make America Strong Again.We will Make America Proud Again.We will Make America Safe Again.We will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God bless.
It's so great to be back in Ohio.
Come November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House and we are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.
We are going to stop the foreign cheating.The era of economic surrender is over.A new era of American Greatness is beginning.No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.One bad deal after another.Hillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.
This subtracts directly from our growth our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.I am promising a new legacy for America.We are going to create a New American Future.But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the Gold Standard"", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.We won't let that happen.We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.It's going to be America First.My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.Here are a few of the things we will do A massive tax cut for working Americans.We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.Hillary Clinton says she wants to ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."""
18554,,1,"Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work and we are going to get your energy bills down.We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.We are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success  a good education, and a great job.Another major part of our agenda is immigration security."
18555,,1,We need to protect American jobs.
18556,,1,"We need to protect American safety.Last night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.Let's also talk about government corruption.No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians."
18557,,1,Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars.
18558,,1,"In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations."
18559,,1,"In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.Here is another example of pay-for-play.In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments including Sudan, Syria, and Iran."
18560,,1,"Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 his highest paying speech.In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.No one will be above the law.We will have one set of rules for everyone."
18561,,1,"In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her and another set of rules for everyone else.I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice."
18562,,1,"The forgotten men and women of America.I am your voice.Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words  Peace Through Strength.We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities."
18563,,1,"Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.My government reforms will make your voice heard not the voice of the special interests.Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.Insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign."
18564,,1,Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.
18565,,1,Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.
18566,,1,"Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change."
18567,,1,I am fighting all of us across the country are fighting for peaceful regime change in our own country.
18568,,1,"The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally."
18569,,1,"We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight  I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make American Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless."
18570,,1,"Thank you.
That's so nice.
Thank you.
Well, that's so nice."
18571,,1,"And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say."
18572,,1,Incredible.
18573,,1,"And some spirit, some spirit."
18574,,1,Talent.
18575,,1,"Thank you.
Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here.
And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.
For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country."
18576,,1,So true.
18577,,1,It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation.
18578,,1,"It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together."
18579,,1,And we're bound together and I see that today.
18580,,1,This has been an amazing day for me.
18581,,1,"The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people.
There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers.
You do right everyday by your community and your families.
You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always.
And defend your right to worship .
.
.
so important.
I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought."
18582,,1,I can tell you that.
18583,,1,"Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future.
Make it stronger.
And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others.
And so many others actually sitting here.
Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long.
So long.
Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that.
Because I'll destroy her image by saying that.
She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor.
And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been .
.
.
Stand up, Ben.
Come here, come here.
Come here, Ben.
This is a great man and great guy.
So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change."
18584,,1,Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back.
18585,,1,I will have a chance .
18586,,1,.
18587,,1,.
18588,,1,Thank you.
18589,,1,We're bringing them back.
18590,,1,We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.
18591,,1,"I will have a chance to discuss school choice.
Its very important.
And how to put every American on the ladder of success.
A great education, a great job.
But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that.
And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson.
It was really an amazing interview.
He is better than the people who do that professionally.
I will tell you.
It's true.
It's true.
It's true.
He's better.
And I didn't really know what I was getting into."
18592,,1,I didn't know.
18593,,1,Is this going to be nice?
18594,,1,Is this going to be wild?
18595,,1,He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy.
18596,,1,I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood.
18597,,1,That's the only problem.
18598,,1,"And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone."
18599,,1,Hollywood is calling.
18600,,1,Look at all those television cameras back there.
18601,,1,Look at all the television cameras.
18602,,1,"I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop."
18603,,1,"Because, it's just one of those things, right?"
18604,,1,"Our nation is too divided.
We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on.
They don't know.
They have no clue.
I'm here today to learn.
So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form.
And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.
Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself."
18605,,1,"I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room."
18606,,1,I believe true reform can only come from outside the system.
18607,,1,I really mean that.
18608,,1,Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening.
18609,,1,And we are going outside the establishment.
18610,,1,"Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln   a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican   has been the greatest honor of my life.
It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.
I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time."
18611,,1,"One that ensures the rights to a great education   so important   and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job."
18612,,1,A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning.
18613,,1,That can happen.
18614,,1,We need to bring our companies back.
18615,,1,"It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs.
I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit.
And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson.
I mean that.
It's been an amazing experience.
It's been an amazing experience.
Really.
Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential."
18616,,1,I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs.
18617,,1,These are incredible people .
18618,,1,.
18619,,1,.
18620,,1,young people.
18621,,1,"Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks""We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together."
18622,,1,That is so true.
18623,,1,So true.
18624,,1,"We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God.
We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together.
All together.
I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right."
18625,,1,I want America prosperous for everyone.
18626,,1,I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that.
18627,,1,We can do that again.
18628,,1,"Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools   especially schools   and new hope.
I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family."
18629,,1,I've had a great family.
18630,,1,"Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world   I've sort of seen a lot   to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before.
And that's many, many people in Detroit.
When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it."
18631,,1,I will do something about it.
18632,,1,"I do get things done, I will tell you."
18633,,1,"Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done."
18634,,1,I'm going to get things done for you.
18635,,1,"Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better.
Much better.
The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity.
We'll get it turned around.
We'll get it turned around, Pastor.
Believe me.
We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people."
18636,,1,I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong.
18637,,1,America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson.
18638,,1,So important.
18639,,1,People have no idea how important they are.
18640,,1,"Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation.
I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow   and I mean that   that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace.
And perhaps we can add the word prosperity.
Ok?
Prosperity.
I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4."
18641,,1,You know it?
18642,,1,"See, most groups I speak to don't know that."
18643,,1,But we know it.
18644,,1,"If you want, we can say it together  'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.'"
18645,,1,And that is so true.
18646,,1,"Thank you very much.
This has been such an honor.
Thank you very much.
Bishop, thank you sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you."
18647,,1,Thank you.
18648,,1,It's great to be back in North Carolina.
18649,,1,"In 62 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?This is the year we can finally fix it.That's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over your moment of liberation is at hand."
18650,,1,"A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.The change will begin my first day in office.First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border."
18651,,1,"This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.But that's just the beginning.I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare."
18652,,1,"Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.It's going to be a very busy first day.I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region."
18653,,1,My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.
18654,,1,She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so.
18655,,1,"This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified."
18656,,1,"We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP."
18657,,1,"She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers not on behalf of global corporations.We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction  they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS."
18658,,1,"Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C."
18659,,1,"The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win and know how to keep us out of endless war.Today, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.That's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton."
18660,,1,"She favors what has been called military adventurism rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military."
18661,,1,This is the ultimate deterrent.We will be guided by those three famous words  Peace Through Strength.I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military.
18662,,1,"Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets."
18663,,1,Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office.
18664,,1,If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.Her conduct is disqualifying.Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents.
18665,,1,"It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information."
18666,,1,"She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter ""C"" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server."
18667,,1,"Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions."
18668,,1,"After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years?"
18669,,1,"The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers."
18670,,1,"People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.It's called pay-for-play.One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti."
18671,,1,Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country.
18672,,1,"We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.People are asking  where did all the money go?This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans."
18673,,1,"She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements."
18674,,1,"That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.58% of African-American youth are not working.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.This is a national crisis and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say  give Donald J. Trump a chance."
18675,,1,What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change?
18676,,1,"We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice."
18677,,1,"I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda."
18678,,1,"We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson."
18679,,1,"It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4  ""No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us."
18680,,1,"Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy  Peace Through Strength.
We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world.
This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.I'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now.
Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism.
The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission.
We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction.
Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering.
Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.
Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent.
Russia has defied this Administration at every turn.
Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple.
She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.Hillary Clinton is just reckless so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack.
Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails.
They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice.
These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.She can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter C"" means confidential.If she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.Her conduct is simply disqualifying.She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is ""failure."""
18681,,1,"Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.Libya was stable.Syria was under control.Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence."
18682,,1,The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.Fast-forward to today.
18683,,1,"What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war."
18684,,1,ISIS controls large portions of territory.
18685,,1,A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.
18686,,1,"And hundreds of thousands are dead.In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments."
18687,,1,"In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.This is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.But that's not all."
18688,,1,"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest."
18689,,1,"We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II."
18690,,1,We currently have the smallest Army since 1940.
18691,,1,The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915.
18692,,1,"And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships."
18693,,1,"When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships."
18694,,1,"Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old."
18695,,1,"We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers their fathers flew the same plane.Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines."
18696,,1,"Today, it's just 182,000.Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions."
18697,,1,"President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.In the current year, we are spending $548 billion a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars."
18698,,1,"This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts."
18699,,1,"Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending."
18700,,1,"In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law."
18701,,1,Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws.
18702,,1,"Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.The military will not be exempt either the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now."
18703,,1,"Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy."
18704,,1,"The Institute for Energy Research cites a ""short-run"" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs."
18705,,1,"We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies we have 23 now.We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel we have 276 ships now.And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions we have 1,113 now.We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea."
18706,,1,"As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."
18707,,1,"The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort  every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities."
18708,,1,"Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department."
18709,,1,"Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure."
18710,,1,I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities.
18711,,1,"At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.America must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans including in our inner cities should get these new jobs.We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.To all those who have served this nation, I say  I will never let you down.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow their example of unity."
18712,,1,"We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.Together, we will have one great American future.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.We will bring back our jobs.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again."
18713,,1,Thank you.
18714,,1,It's great to be here today.
18715,,1,"In particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.Today, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign  school choice.But before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails."
18716,,1,"According to the FBI report  ""The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account."
18717,,1,"Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program among many other extremely sensitive matters.This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief.
By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.Throughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.
These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.It's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena.
Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times.
She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information.
She even said she didn't know that the letter C"" stood for confidential classified information.All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart."
18718,,1,"Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria."
18719,,1,"She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons not to mention the ransom payments.On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy."
18720,,1,"She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes."
18721,,1,"She believes in globalism, not Americanism.Last night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya."
18722,,1,"Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race."
18723,,1,"I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out letting ISIS fill the void.But I was opposed to the war from the beginning.Long after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that ""perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet,"" and that ""the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned."
18724,,1,"Then, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess,"" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.In July of 2003, I said that ""I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly."""
18725,,1,"I had a number of quotes to this effect.Then, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine."
18726,,1,"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in.
I would never have handled it that way.
Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country?
C'mon.
Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.What was the purpose of the whole thing?
Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed.
And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs?
Not to mention the other side.
All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces.
And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong.
All this for nothing!I would have been tougher on terrorism.
Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.
Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition."
18727,,1,"For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.Here is the bottom line  I was a private citizen."
18728,,1,I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had.
18729,,1,"But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator."
18730,,1,"All talk, but nothing happened.We're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Meanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.It's time to rebuild America.Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.We are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts our whole country hurts.My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans will be placed on the ladder of success  a great education, and a great job.That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation  safety.In order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.You can't have prosperity without security.This is the new civil rights agenda of our time."
18731,,1,"The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.It is time to break-up that monopoly.I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom the civil right to attend the school of their choice."
18732,,1,"This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative with billions left over."
18733,,1,"It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.Let's run through the numbers.At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year."
18734,,1,"That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.The federal government pays for about 10 percent $64 billion, to be precise of the K-12 costs."
18735,,1,That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world.
18736,,1,"Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.New York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.Baltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.Chicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.Not only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family not the needs of the Teachers' Union."
18737,,1,"There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.The current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.Failing schools then contribute to failing economies.In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent."
18738,,1,"In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.In Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty."
18739,,1,"In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent."
18740,,1,"In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.Nationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty including 45% of children under the age of six.Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.Meanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015."
18741,,1,Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%.
18742,,1,"There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.Government is failing our citizens at every level.That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.Here is how it will work.Right now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide."
18743,,1,"These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts."
18744,,1,"This covers about 400,000 students in our country.Altogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice."
18745,,1,"This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.Specifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend."
18746,,1,"Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds."
18747,,1,Ohio is a leader in school choice.
18748,,1,"Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.But the $20 billion is only the beginning."
18749,,1,"As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.Each state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level."
18750,,1,"To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community."
18751,,1,"In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.The money will follow the student."
18752,,1,"That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.As your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice."
18753,,1,I understand many stale old politicians will resist.
18754,,1,But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again.
18755,,1,"We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America."
18756,,1,"We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others."
18757,,1,"By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past."
18758,,1,We've had a failed foreign policy.
18759,,1,A failed education policy.
18760,,1,A failed economic policy.
18761,,1,"And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have or how many journalists they know not how many Americans they help to live better lives.But the failures of the past are about to end.Those failures end beginning on November 8th.We will have One American Nation.We will be One American People.We are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.That means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.This is how we will rebuild our future.This is how We Will Make America Great Again For Everyone.Thank you."
18762,,1,Thank you.
18763,,1,Thank you very much.
18764,,1,"Oh, Jon."
18765,,1,Jon is such a great actor and such a great person.
18766,,1,He is such a great person.
18767,,1,And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways.
18768,,1,He's been incredible.
18769,,1,So I just want to thank Jon.
18770,,1,"And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies."
18771,,1,"[ ]  In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership."
18772,,1,And we know all about that.
18773,,1,"And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.AUDIENCE MEMBER  Thank you!MR."
18774,,1,TRUMP  Thank you.
18775,,1,"Amazing, amazing group.One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community."
18776,,1,"And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you."
18777,,1,All across the nation.
18778,,1,A lot of people said  I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals.
18779,,1,I got the evangelicals.
18780,,1,"I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch."
18781,,1,"There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States."
18782,,1,True.
18783,,1,So true.
18784,,1,"I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people."
18785,,1,"I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need."
18786,,1,Franklin Graham is an example.
18787,,1,He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana.
18788,,1,And he didn't want anything for it.
18789,,1,He's a great man.
18790,,1,"It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble."
18791,,1,"Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith."
18792,,1,And you understand that.
18793,,1,All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.AUDIENCE MEMBER  Right!MR.
18794,,1,"TRUMP  It is right, isn't it?"
18795,,1,"Yeah, it is right."
18796,,1,Not even close.
18797,,1,"Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation."
18798,,1,So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly?
18799,,1,"One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent."
18800,,1,"And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her."
18801,,1,"So let me say this right up front  A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before."
18802,,1,Believe me.
18803,,1,I believe it.
18804,,1,And you believe it.
18805,,1,And you know it.
18806,,1,You know it.
18807,,1,"And that includes religious liberty remember, remember."
18808,,1,"I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International."
18809,,1,Stand up if you're member.
18810,,1,That's good.
18811,,1,That was a great that was an amazing experience.
18812,,1,"And the bishop, what a great guy."
18813,,1,"In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church and this is all across the country for centuries have been the conscience of our nation."
18814,,1,"Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future."
18815,,1,Very true.
18816,,1,Amazing.
18817,,1,This was such an amazing experience.
18818,,1,This is the power of faith.
18819,,1,It's the power to heal.
18820,,1,It's the power to unite.
18821,,1,It's the power to make all of us live better lives all of us.
18822,,1,Our nation today is divided.
18823,,1,"Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation."
18824,,1,"It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity."
18825,,1,"Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values."
18826,,1,"So let's talk today about some of the things and these are great things that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back."
18827,,1,It's been taken away.
18828,,1,The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits.
18829,,1,"If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so."
18830,,1,"If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings   on religious matters."
18831,,1,"And I will repeal the Johnson amendment   if I am elected your president, I promise."
18832,,1,So important.Thank you.
18833,,1,"That's so important.And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan."
18834,,1,I had 50 pastors in a big conference room.
18835,,1,"And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests."
18836,,1,We were all talking.
18837,,1,And we were there for two hours.
18838,,1,"And at the end, it was a love-fest."
18839,,1,We all agreed.
18840,,1,It was like a love-fest.And I said to them we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue and I said to them I'd love your support.
18841,,1,And I know when I can get support.
18842,,1,I'm quite sophisticated.
18843,,1,"And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries."
18844,,1,And I said I really would like your support.
18845,,1,And they didn't really know what I was talking about.
18846,,1,"And I said, what's going on here?"
18847,,1,"They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws."
18848,,1,"And I said, what's the punishment?"
18849,,1,"Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.I said, tell me about this."
18850,,1,And we sat down.
18851,,1,They talked about it.
18852,,1,When did it happen?
18853,,1,1954 or so.
18854,,1,Lyndon Johnson was having problems powerful guy.
18855,,1,"I actually, as just own way you have to gain respect for what he was able to do."
18856,,1,Can you imagine that this man single-handedly he was having problems with churches.
18857,,1,"And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason."
18858,,1,"And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk."
18859,,1,"And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty."
18860,,1,"And one of the pastors, who I knew very well and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just and magnificent hearts, much more importantly they looked at me and they said, that's actually right."
18861,,1,They have more power than we do.
18862,,1,We're not allowed to express.And that's what I said.
18863,,1,We have to start thinking about this.
18864,,1,And I thought about it.
18865,,1,And then we had a large group of pastors again.
18866,,1,I said I have thought about it.
18867,,1,"If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment."
18868,,1,We are going to do that.
18869,,1,And it's not going to be hard.
18870,,1,It's not going to be hard.
18871,,1,"When you when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent."
18872,,1,"You're much more than 50 percent, added together."
18873,,1,"And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right?"
18874,,1,"I really believe that, because you're great people."
18875,,1,"The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law."
18876,,1,"And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of we're going to get rid of it so fast.And I'm so proud to say honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second."
18877,,1,I am so proud I was just telling this to Tony to say that was my idea.
18878,,1,"I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very   the only way."
18879,,1,"So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK?"
18880,,1,So important.I hope which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th.
18881,,1,You cannot you didn't vote four years ago.
18882,,1,You didn't vote.AUDIENCE MEMBER  I did.MR.
18883,,1,TRUMP  You did?
18884,,1,"Well, you did."
18885,,1,A few of you did.
18886,,1,"Believe me, I know."
18887,,1,I look at the stats.
18888,,1,You didn't vote.
18889,,1,But this time you really have and this is your last chance.
18890,,1,This is it.
18891,,1,"I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again."
18892,,1,"So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK?"
18893,,1,November 8th.
18894,,1,Thank you.
18895,,1,"And if you do, we're going to win by a lot."
18896,,1,That's not going to even be a close election.
18897,,1,"And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare   which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens."
18898,,1,And the numbers are horrendous.
18899,,1,"Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent."
18900,,1,"The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period very, very long."
18901,,1,It is a disaster.
18902,,1,"It's a disaster, and everybody knows it."
18903,,1,"And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives much better health care at a much lower price."
18904,,1,"Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America."
18905,,1,That's what she wants.
18906,,1,That's what she's aiming at.
18907,,1,That's what Obama wanted.
18908,,1,"He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice."
18909,,1,And I can't possibly emphasize this enough.
18910,,1,Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools.
18911,,1,"This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community none."
18912,,1,"The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years over a hundred years."
18913,,1,"Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York."
18914,,1,It's a disaster.
18915,,1,"She's going to produce jobs, big thing jobs, we're going to bring back jobs."
18916,,1,Been a catastrophe.
18917,,1,We've lost tens of thousands of jobs.
18918,,1,She never did a thing.
18919,,1,"It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action."
18920,,1,"She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen."
18921,,1,Only bad will happen.
18922,,1,But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York.
18923,,1,"She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing."
18924,,1,Jobs left.
18925,,1,"It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country."
18926,,1,So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs.
18927,,1,I know jobs.
18928,,1,She doesn't know jobs.
18929,,1,That I can tell you.
18930,,1,"I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job."
18931,,1,"And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents and I say it with great respect our inner cities are a disaster crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad."
18932,,1,"I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose?"
18933,,1,It can't get any worse.
18934,,1,It can't get any worse.
18935,,1,"You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem."
18936,,1,You're going to have safety.
18937,,1,You're going to have good education.
18938,,1,"We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back."
18939,,1,Mexico's taking our jobs.
18940,,1,"So many other places, they're taking our jobs."
18941,,1,What China's doing to us is horrible.
18942,,1,We're going to have jobs.
18943,,1,What do you have to lose?
18944,,1,I'm going to fix this.
18945,,1,I'm going to fix it.
18946,,1,"School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice."
18947,,1,Competition the schools the schools will get better and better and better.
18948,,1,"And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school."
18949,,1,School choice also means that parents can home-school their children.
18950,,1,"Hundred percent.Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests."
18951,,1,"Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty."
18952,,1,"The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children   including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them."
18953,,1,This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs.
18954,,1,"However that's good, right?"
18955,,1,"However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs."
18956,,1,"If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America."
18957,,1,What a difference this is going to make.
18958,,1,"The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family."
18959,,1,"In so many ways, you're going to have choice."
18960,,1,My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city anybody anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program and there will be a lot of them to provide school choice to every child in that community.
18961,,1,"In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student."
18962,,1,"As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen."
18963,,1,"This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around."
18964,,1,"Again, the education can't get worse."
18965,,1,Commo Core we're going to end it.
18966,,1,We're bringing education local.
18967,,1,I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures.
18968,,1,"The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education."
18969,,1,"Don't be surprised remember this, November 8th don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago."
18970,,1,You see what's going on?
18971,,1,They're starting people are starting to hear about this.
18972,,1,"And they're saying, wow."
18973,,1,Wow.
18974,,1,They're liking it.
18975,,1,"And again, can't get any worse."
18976,,1,It's going to get a lot better.
18977,,1,But only if I do it.
18978,,1,They can't do it.
18979,,1,"The Democrats, they have what they've done is incredible."
18980,,1,And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same rigid.
18981,,1,It'll never change.
18982,,1,"Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 it's not going to change."
18983,,1,Not going to happen.
18984,,1,"Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court."
18985,,1,"Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia."
18986,,1,"The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others."
18987,,1,"It could even be I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president."
18988,,1,It would be record-setting.
18989,,1,Probably be three.
18990,,1,Could be four.
18991,,1,Could even be five.
18992,,1,"And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country."
18993,,1,It will be a disaster.
18994,,1,"One of the most important issues, frankly other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted."
18995,,1,We're going to take care of our vets.
18996,,1,"We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things."
18997,,1,"But one of the most important some people think it's actually the most important is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court."
18998,,1,You see what's happening right now?
18999,,1,Essentially it's four and four.
19000,,1,And you see what how bad it is.
19001,,1,We're going to pick great judges.
19002,,1,"I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people."
19003,,1,And we are going to put truly great people.
19004,,1,"Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK?"
19005,,1,"This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly."
19006,,1,That's what's going to happen.
19007,,1,"I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written."
19008,,1,We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans.
19009,,1,We're not going to have that.
19010,,1,"I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process."
19011,,1,Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list.
19012,,1,And we brought it up.
19013,,1,Let's see a list.
19014,,1,You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well.
19015,,1,Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public.
19016,,1,They'd be rejected.
19017,,1,"Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four."
19018,,1,If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably as you know it you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye.
19019,,1,And we don't want to see that.Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security.
19020,,1,Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.
19021,,1,It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.
19022,,1,Failed at everything.
19023,,1,"Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power."
19024,,1,They were dying three years ago.
19025,,1,The sanctions were choking them.
19026,,1,They would have fallen.
19027,,1,"But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time."
19028,,1,But remember the ransom payments.
19029,,1,"Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago."
19030,,1,But then they made a mistake.
19031,,1,This is cash.
19032,,1,"Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account."
19033,,1,There was no way of sending it into a checking account.
19034,,1,"All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember?"
19035,,1,You can use your plan.
19036,,1,"You can use your doctors 27 times, right?"
19037,,1,Twenty-seven times.
19038,,1,"You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie."
19039,,1,It's all a lie.
19040,,1,It's all a big lie.
19041,,1,It's a rigged system and it's a lie.And I'll tell you what.
19042,,1,I'll tell you what.
19043,,1,"The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash cash."
19044,,1,"And I actually said they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror."
19045,,1,"I said, no, they don't need it for terror."
19046,,1,They've got 150 billion (dollars).
19047,,1,That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back.
19048,,1,I said they don't need it.
19049,,1,This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts.
19050,,1,They're not going to use it for terror.
19051,,1,"They have plenty of money for terror.Think of it $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash massive, big vats of cash."
19052,,1,You saw them cartons.
19053,,1,I never saw anything like it.
19054,,1,I've seen a lot of cash.
19055,,1,"Hey, never saw anything like this $1.7 billion (dollars)."
19056,,1,Can you imagine these guys?
19057,,1,Planes get they stop.
19058,,1,"Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages."
19059,,1,They waited there for hours and hours.
19060,,1,"And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something."
19061,,1,It was this just another lie.But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash?
19062,,1,"Ai, yai, yai."
19063,,1,They think we're stupid.
19064,,1,They think we're stupid.
19065,,1,They won't be thinking it for long.
19066,,1,Very sad.
19067,,1,"At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross."
19068,,1,ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East.
19069,,1,We cannot let this evil continue can 't let it.
19070,,1,"ISIS must be destroyed have to; have no choice.To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare."
19071,,1,It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago different world.We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism   words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use.
19072,,1,"Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates."
19073,,1,And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more.
19074,,1,But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria.
19075,,1,"They take others, but they don't take Christians very, very, very rare.So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region."
19076,,1,We want to take care of people.
19077,,1,"But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this."
19078,,1,This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country.
19079,,1,It's from within.
19080,,1,This could be the all-time great Trojan horse.
19081,,1,This could be it.You ever notice on the you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones.
19082,,1,Cellphones.
19083,,1,And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them.
19084,,1,"And some of them have things far worse than that scenes far worse than that.So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place."
19085,,1,"If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now."
19086,,1,"Now she wants to get rid of oh, we're going to get rid of them."
19087,,1,"You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground."
19088,,1,"Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it."
19089,,1,Don't say it!
19090,,1,"Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins."
19091,,1,"Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president."
19092,,1,"Can you   they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton."
19093,,1,But even if you believe and I can understand that.
19094,,1,"No boots on the ground, I can understand."
19095,,1,You don't say it!
19096,,1,Let them think they're going to go through hell.
19097,,1,Don't say it!
19098,,1,"Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today General Flynn, who's here someplace   I love General Flynn but can you imagine these people saying I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy  there will be no boots on the ground."
19099,,1,"If you don't want that, I fully understand."
19100,,1,Don't say it!
19101,,1,Don't say it!
19102,,1,"Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind?"
19103,,1,"We're going to hit them from the front, then and everything they say turns out to be true?"
19104,,1,"You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy."
19105,,1,Does that make sense?
19106,,1,Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that.
19107,,1,"Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya."
19108,,1,The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy.
19109,,1,She really is.
19110,,1,"She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of probably will be boots, you know."
19111,,1,Probably will turn out to be another disaster.
19112,,1,He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death.
19113,,1,"She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are."
19114,,1,"And they take over, and they're far worse."
19115,,1,"This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism."
19116,,1,"And by the way, that includes Russia."
19117,,1,"If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned."
19118,,1,"It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends."
19119,,1,That's life.But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.
19120,,1,We have some real enemies.
19121,,1,"Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails."
19122,,1,These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena.
19123,,1,What's that?
19124,,1,"Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them."
19125,,1,"She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer."
19126,,1,"Did anybody ever hit a hammer you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people."
19127,,1,Can you believe this?
19128,,1,"Destroyed them with a hammer the old-fashioned way, I guess."
19129,,1,The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum did anybody see that?
19130,,1,How did I do?
19131,,1,Good.
19132,,1,"Well, we have a big debate coming up."
19133,,1,Who knows what's going to happen there?
19134,,1,"But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief."
19135,,1,We had the polls came out after that event and we won big league.
19136,,1,Now we have a debate coming up.
19137,,1,"I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right?"
19138,,1,AUDIENCE MEMBER  Don't take her bait.
19139,,1,Don't take her bait.MR.
19140,,1,TRUMP  I won't; I promise.
19141,,1,Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly.
19142,,1,That's why she lost.
19143,,1,That's why she did so poorly.
19144,,1,She was terrible.
19145,,1,"She was honestly, I shouldn't be saying this she was terrible."
19146,,1,She keeps talking about the emails.
19147,,1,"Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently."
19148,,1,"It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer."
19149,,1,"But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered an unheard-of practice hammers them into total silence."
19150,,1,You know what happening.
19151,,1,"You know what's happening.I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career."
19152,,1,It's true.
19153,,1,It's true.
19154,,1,So her answers were bad.
19155,,1,They were bad.
19156,,1,And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest.
19157,,1,"And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer."
19158,,1,I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job.
19159,,1,"I mean, his questions to me were very tough."
19160,,1,"But the gentleman who stood up and said  Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did   to me, that was the tough one."
19161,,1,"That was the tough hey, that was a tough question."
19162,,1,"It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right?"
19163,,1,"Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons."
19164,,1,True.
19165,,1,True.
19166,,1,"She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement."
19167,,1,It's just so bad.
19168,,1,It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government.
19169,,1,Have to do it.
19170,,1,"And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need."
19171,,1,There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians.
19172,,1,And all of us through and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty.
19173,,1,"Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help."
19174,,1,"As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country millions of new jobs."
19175,,1,We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies.
19176,,1,They've gone to other countries.
19177,,1,They've gone to Mexico.
19178,,1,They've gone to many other countries.
19179,,1,China's taking massive advantage of us.
19180,,1,"It's all so easy, believe me."
19181,,1,"It's all so easy.That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses."
19182,,1,"It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations."
19183,,1,"It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege."
19184,,1,I will also renegotiate NAFTA.
19185,,1,"And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me."
19186,,1,"We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job."
19187,,1,"It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first."
19188,,1,"Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values."
19189,,1,The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda.
19190,,1,Has to be.
19191,,1,"Thank you.Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly."
19192,,1,"Great woman, really great woman."
19193,,1,We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones.
19194,,1,I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis.
19195,,1,Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America.
19196,,1,"She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians."
19197,,1,The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God.
19198,,1,Phyllis understood that.
19199,,1,"Phyllis understood that.And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily   something that was so easy to do."
19200,,1,And she was incredible.
19201,,1,She was so brave.
19202,,1,"She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time."
19203,,1,"People said, Trump?"
19204,,1,"She said, he's going to win, you don't understand."
19205,,1,He knows how to win.
19206,,1,He's going to win.
19207,,1,"They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump."
19208,,1,"And we went boom, boom, boom."
19209,,1,"But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that."
19210,,1,That had a huge impact.
19211,,1,"She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart."
19212,,1,"And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really that's a celebration."
19213,,1,She was 92 years old.
19214,,1,"We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator."
19215,,1,"If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless."
19216,,1,"There is nothing we as Americans can't do.There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country."
19217,,1,"It's from 1 John, Chapter 4  ""No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us."
19218,,1,"AUDIENCE MEMBER  Amen.MR.
TRUMP  So true.
So true.
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.
It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.This is my promise to all of you  starting in 2017, we will be one American nation.
It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future.
Have to do it.
Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again.
Thank you very much, and God bless you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home.
Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today.
We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.
Let me open by making this very important declaration  I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.The special interests have had their day.
That chapter in our history is closing.The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.
A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.This will be your time.
You will be running the show.
Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.Change is coming.All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.It's your turn now.
This is your time.The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change not partisan change.We are fighting for all Americans Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals who've been failed by this corrupt system.
We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.We're also fighting for every region of this country.
For every part of Florida, and every part of America.
From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first and that keep jobs in our country.
All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.
We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA.
China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs.
We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America.
The era of economic surrender is over.We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.In this new future, we are going to raise your wages.
Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up.
Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense.
Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton much of it to her personal bank account to keep you from having the future you deserve.But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies.
At the center of my plan is school choice.
I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words  Peace Through Strength.That means rebuilding our badly depleted military.
I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions.
Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen.
Her policies have produced massive global disorder.She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world.
ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood.
Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too without any plan for the day after.She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive.
By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset.
She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return.
Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength not weakness.
And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States.
Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away.
That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever.
They just keep losing.I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal.
We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past.
A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences.
I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have.
No more apology tours.
No more bowing to foreign powers.
We proudly defend America at every single turn.America will get the respect it deserves.And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before.
And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy.
She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal.
She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place?
Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding.
She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world.
If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth.
Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure.
Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.It's the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win and how to avoid endless war.Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain.
That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.And we will be clear in naming our enemy  Radical Islamic Terrorism.The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country.
This is one single fact she can never escape.Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.That applies to everything.Change is needed at every single level of our society.When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.The possibilities for our future are unlimited.The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons.
They want to scare you out of voting for change.
The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase.
It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation.
We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages  I will be your champion.All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers.
I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives.
There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.This is our chance.
It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world.
You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.Massive tax reductions and tax simplification so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money.
Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.Once again, we will be One American Nation.We Will Be One American People.Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!
This is our chance our one chance to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.
Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.All of these reform plans are available on our website.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders.
You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.Above all else, you are Americans and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.We've released policy after policy, solution after solution.Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restriction on American energy this will create another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing.
I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.
Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization another Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology.
And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena.
They used a special software called bleach bit.She even made her 13 different phones disappear some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family in Haiti.Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law.She also believes that she is above all of you.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a basket of deplorables."""
19219,,1,"She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment."
19220,,1,"They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans."
19221,,1,She looks down on them she looks down on all the people who make her life possible.
19222,,1,"She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants."
19223,,1,"She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.She called these Americans every name in the book racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic she said they were not even American.Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know  your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street."
19224,,1,Her goal is simple  to bully the American voter out of voting for change.The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are.
19225,,1,They want to keep our terrible trade deals.
19226,,1,They want to trap children in failing government schools.
19227,,1,They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country.
19228,,1,"No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration and that have been dismissed by my opponent are a permanent stain on this government."
19229,,1,It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.We must take care of our Veterans.
19230,,1,"That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its performance records available to consumers.The scandals never seem to end but they will, when I'm elected President.Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients."
19231,,1,"I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.We are on a mission of change.That includes a new agenda for our inner cities.The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.For those suffering and hurting, I say  give Donald J. Trump a chance."
19232,,1,I will fix it.
19233,,1,"What do you have to lose?Let me also tell you what you have to gain  millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.We will keep our children safe which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Government corruption will end.Honesty will be restored.Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America prosperous again.We will make America safe again.And will Make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
19234,,1,Thank you.
19235,,1,I am honored to be here today.
19236,,1,"Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you."
19237,,1,"The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.Our debt to you is eternal.Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks."
19238,,1,"The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas including those with multiple deployments."
19239,,1,"Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.If I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion."
19240,,1,"I will not let you down.I am running to be a President for all Americans and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community."
19241,,1,"There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.They embody the goodness and decency of our country.I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life."
19242,,1,"We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized."
19243,,1,"These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American."
19244,,1,"She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.She called them a ""basket of deplorables"" in both a speech and an interview."
19245,,1,"She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh."
19246,,1,"They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.Hillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.To this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless."
19247,,1,"It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless."
19248,,1,"I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.I am running to be your voice.Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent."
19249,,1,"Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter."
19250,,1,You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered.
19251,,1,"In fact, she hasn't backed down at all she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.Let's be clear."
19252,,1,These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton.
19253,,1,"These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words."
19254,,1,"These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change."
19255,,1,"She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists."
19256,,1,They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes.
19257,,1,"They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced."
19258,,1,"They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas."
19259,,1,"She's protected from her own policies.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.We are the campaign of school choice.We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester."
19260,,1,"In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.You are there to respond to every natural disaster.You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.In a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.You will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.We will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.Our gratitude is everlasting.We will protect those who protect us.And we will follow your example of unity working in common purpose and common cause.We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.We will rebuild our military and our country.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless you all."
19261,,1,Thank you.
19262,,1,"I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country."
19263,,1,"She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today."
19264,,1,"I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience  Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.Our campaign is about ideas."
19265,,1,We're about solutions.
19266,,1,"I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things."
19267,,1,"I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people."
19268,,1,"Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force."
19269,,1,"Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense even more than housing.Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area and my opponent has no childcare plan.Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home."
19270,,1,"There is no financial security.But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight."
19271,,1,"Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributionsto their families and to our society."
19272,,1,"Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate."
19273,,1,Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax a major relief for low-income parents.
19274,,1,"This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account."
19275,,1,"Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free."
19276,,1,"Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities."
19277,,1,"Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury."
19278,,1,"Instead, the funds rollover so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reformsI outlined last week.The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18."
19279,,1,"Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match."
19280,,1,"To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions."
19281,,1,"The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities."
19282,,1,"We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button including services like nanny-sharing."
19283,,1,Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well.
19284,,1,"This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time."
19285,,1,"Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services."
19286,,1,"Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave."
19287,,1,"This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing."
19288,,1,"By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit."
19289,,1,"This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings."
19290,,1,"Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President."
19291,,1,"It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, loveyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.It is time to Believe In America.Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone."
19292,,1,Thank you.
19293,,1,It is so great to be back in Iowa.
19294,,1,Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.
19295,,1,"Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.The White House will become the People's House."
19296,,1,"We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow and they will grow rapidly.This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign."
19297,,1,"She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.I am running to be a President for all Americans Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone."
19298,,1,"Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life."
19299,,1,"We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear including with a hammer so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena."
19300,,1,"Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs here we don't have either."
19301,,1,"This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office  ""she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true."
19302,,1,"The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.
Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009.
And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.That includes our family farms right here in Iowa.Family farms are the backbone of this country.
We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words  jobs, jobs, jobs.That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the lack of transparency,"" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about and I quote ""the stupidity of the American voter."""
19303,,1,This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton and the voters have had enough.
19304,,1,They're taking their country back.Another major reform is going to be school choice.
19305,,1,"I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six."
19306,,1,58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year.
19307,,1,"Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year."
19308,,1,There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.To those suffering and hurting I say  what do you have to lose vote for Donald J. Trump.
19309,,1,I will fix it.
19310,,1,"I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.I will make your communities safe.Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse."
19311,,1,"The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees."
19312,,1,"According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share."
19313,,1,Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense.
19314,,1,"I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.In all things, it's time to put Americans first and start taking care of each other.Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment."
19315,,1,"I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation."
19316,,1,"American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
19317,,1,"Thank you, Ohio."
19318,,1,It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.
19319,,1,We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN.
19320,,1,"We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.The people of the United States are ready for change."
19321,,1,"They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan."
19322,,1,The city of Flint was once known as Buick City.
19323,,1,"More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 today, its less than 8,000."
19324,,1,Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty.
19325,,1,"Violent crime is among the nation's highest.Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis."
19326,,1,"The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico."
19327,,1,"Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around."
19328,,1,"We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities."
19329,,1,"Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years."
19330,,1,"Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future."
19331,,1,"Lower crime, better schools, more jobs safety, security, opportunity.Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now."
19332,,1,I will campaign hard for their votes we can't stay the course our country is on.
19333,,1,"If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.I am willing to campaign anywhere."
19334,,1,"I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable."
19335,,1,"I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations."
19336,,1,"I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.The economic policies of Hillary Clinton on trade, on the economy, on immigration have devastated the inner cities of America."
19337,,1,Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.Hillary Clinton believes in globalism taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries.
19338,,1,I am not running to be President of the world I am running to be President of the United States.
19339,,1,"I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change it's time to vote for America and America First.Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term."
19340,,1,"That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life."
19341,,1,"You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino."
19342,,1,"You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between."
19343,,1,"But above everything else, you are all Americans.Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale."
19344,,1,"Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure."
19345,,1,"Just look at what she did to the Middle East in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya."
19346,,1,"Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.One failure after another all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force."
19347,,1,Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009.
19348,,1,"And the national debt has doubled.I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words  jobs, jobs, jobs.That begins with a new America-First trade policy.Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP she called it the ""Gold Standard."
19349,,1,"Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.We won't let that happen.
But you have to get out and vote.My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders.
Let me be your champion.In all things, it's time to put Americans first and start taking care of each other.Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States not in China, and all over the world.We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again like never before.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission  clean air and safe water.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.
American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.
Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy.
It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited.
The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed.
In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM today it is less than 8,000.
Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn this around.My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in.
Failing schools can become flourishing schools.
Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure.
Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment.
And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.All of these things, and so much more, are possible.
But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test  does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.My opponent's plan rejects this optimism.
She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers.
The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check.
Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people.
Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end.
I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans.
My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know  they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos but above everything else, they are all American.
They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.These are the forgotten men and women of America.
People who work hard but don't have a voice.I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.I'm not running to be President of the world.
I'm running to be President of the United States and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.It's time to start thinking big once again.That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal.
Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs.
You can visit our website to see the math.This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.It will be deficit neutral.
If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter that translates to millions of lost jobs.This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years.
Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt.
It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.Instead, the opposite happened.
We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.Never has so much money been spent so poorly.But we're going to turn that all around.
Here's how.It begins with bold new tax reform.As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3.
The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer.
They will receive the biggest benefit it won't even be close.This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents.
Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families.
The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives.
Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit in the form a Childcare rebate and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent.
An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created.
It will be amazing to watch.We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate.
Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion.
By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs and that means jobs in our poorest communities.Next, comes regulations.One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year.
Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule.
It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year.
This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America.
Remember what Hillary Clinton said?
She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.Energy reform is central to our plan as wellAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production.
According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama creating countless more jobs in the process.Finally, comes trade the foundation for everythingAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year an enormous drag on growth.Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate.
But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals.
The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The verdict is in.
All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America.
This includes the following steps I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.
I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country.
We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China.
China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs.
According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.Here is how the plan adds upWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored.
This includes the childcare plan.Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.That leaves around $800 billion dollars.
This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms.
If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit.
Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.This is what our new future will look likeI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you.
It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.
New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country including four points here in Florida.
LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for the people it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote.
I am running to be a President for all Americans.I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes.
What incredible people.Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life.
You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic but above all else, you are American.Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders.
We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers as well as law enforcement officers across the country.And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists.
It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book and Americans have had enough.They want solutions, and they want better lives not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists.
They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes.
They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced.
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world.
It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home.
I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.That future begins with prosperity at home.My economic agenda can be summed up in three words  jobs, jobs, jobs.One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.
African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century.
They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty.
More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone.
58% of African-American youth are not working.These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years her disastrous record speaks for itself.The only people she delivers for is her donors.I am going to deliver for you, the American people.If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.That's just the beginning.Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.I am also going to completely reform our trade deals.
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP.
We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.Another major reform is going to be school choice.
I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty.
This is unacceptable.
To the Hispanic community I say  we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime.
But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands.
Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.Let's also talk about Venezuela.Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people.
But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.
American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.And Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims.
I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows.
Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help.
But I never will.I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign.
But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.You are heroes.
And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives.
Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized.
Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way.
Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.It's happening every single day.All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate.
But let me give you the most important number of all.
That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration.
Let me tell you what that number is  ZERO.Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws.
What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?What do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?What do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?This must end.
And it must end right now.
Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.Just look at what's happened in the last few days.Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.Earlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant.
The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013.
Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa.
This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released.
One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk.
But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back.
Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.Now, my opponent will never meet with you.
She will never hear your stories.
She will never share in your pain.She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants.
Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border.
Sanctuary Cities.
Ignoring visa overstays.
Closing detention centers.
And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.But the media doesn't want you to know any of that.
So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan.
Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody or at the border.
She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.Your cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost.
To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.But help is coming.
On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.Together, we will save American lives and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.According to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now.
However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught.
Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.At the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism.
We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.Whether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country.
The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.Let's just remember our goal to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.That is what is at stake in this election.So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.
[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK]These wounded American families have been alone.
But they are alone no longer.I am here standing with you.
The American people are here standing with you.
And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.
Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to bring back your jobs.We are going to cut your taxes.We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey.
These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.Attack after attack from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.So let me state this very clearly  immigration security is national security.My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency.
As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.
Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term with no effective way to screen or vet them.
Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life.
We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering.
Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders.
This is unacceptable.Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism.
In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists.
She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign many of them cops and soldiers deplorable and irredeemable.
Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas?
Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable?
In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty where is Hillary's condemnation here?Let's ask Hillary Clinton  how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country.
Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction.
Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.It's also time to remember one very important word  accountability.
All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS.
Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides aid and comfort,"" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office."
19350,,1,"Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide."
19351,,1,And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion?
19352,,1,That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers.
19353,,1,"I have news for Hillary Clinton  refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country."
19354,,1,How is this a smart policy?Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.We must stop the massive inflow of refugees which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase.
19355,,1,"We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith– are commonplace.It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home."
19356,,1,"Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.It is time to have a new American Future.We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism."
19357,,1,"This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.We are going to rebuild our country.And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six."
19358,,1,58% of African-American youth are not working.Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year.
19359,,1,"Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.To the African-American community, I say  vote for Donald J. Trump."
19360,,1,"I will fix it I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.My whole life has been about creating jobs."
19361,,1,"Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA."
19362,,1,"I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.But we are going to turn it all around.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation."
19363,,1,"American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
19364,,1,Thank you.
19365,,1,It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.
19366,,1,Great polls keep coming in.
19367,,1,"A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American  safety.We are going to Make America Safe Again.The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens."
19368,,1,"It must be ended.The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.Who is looking out for them?For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight  I'm with you and I will fight for you.The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective."
19369,,1,"Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable."
19370,,1,"I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.But to do this, we must work with our police not against our police.Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.The problem is not that there are too many police."
19371,,1,"The problem is that there are not enough police.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude."
19372,,1,They are the line separating civilization from chaos.Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night.
19373,,1,"No, it's the poor family living in the inner city it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.Who is there to represent these families?Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices."
19374,,1,"So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country."
19375,,1,"People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities."
19376,,1,"We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century."
19377,,1,"It's time for change it's time for a New American Future.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."""
19378,,1,"That she has been ""fighting for children."""
19379,,1,"Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty?"
19380,,1,"Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare?"
19381,,1,"You know the old saying, ""Watch what I do, not what I say."
19382,,1,"At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions.
I have employed thousands of women in my company.
Women of different backgrounds.
Women of many talents.And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight.
A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege.
The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish.
Education is the bedrock of our society.Women also value security.
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders.
As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use.
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs.
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use.
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders.
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change.
Every change starts with a conversation.
Together, we will have this conversation.
And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.This will unleash a technology revolution.
America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future.
The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner.
All we have to do is remove the red tape.Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history.
It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.
Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables.
This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors.
We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization.
These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries we are going to bring them back.Jobs will come flowing back in all over America.It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We're going to turn it all around.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign and not mine.
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations.
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.Let me tell you what else we're going to do.One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education.
The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments.
These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away.
In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.But they should be using the money on the students for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college but to increase it.We have to break this cycle.
I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars paid for by you that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.Another major issue for all American families is healthcare.
President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars.
Instead, the opposite happened the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.Just one more Washington lie like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.It's a disaster.That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first.
These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens bankrupting these programs for Americans.She doesn't understand how Democracy works.
Public servants are just that they're there to serve you.
But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment.
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World.
I am running to be President of the United States.
I Am For America and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again.
Fixing things is what I do.
Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be.
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors.
You have to pick up that phone.
Go to our website to learn more.
You have to campaign on the streets.
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 46 days to change the world.
You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017 I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Good morning.
Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.
I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today.
Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.Let me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.It is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City.
Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation.
Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.We all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens.
Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand.
Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader.
How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate.
But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community.
The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities.
It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.
Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities.
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York.
The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.
Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success  a great education, and a good-paying job.
To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas hunted down for execution continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude.
They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.In addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity.
That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.This brings us to the subject of energy.Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again especially for the poorest Americans.America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.It's all upside  more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities including right here in Pennsylvania.According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following increase GDP by more than $100 billion annuallyadd over 500,000 new jobs annuallyincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 yearsincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decadesincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama creating countless more jobs in the process.Overall, my entire economic plan tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today turning America into a jobs magnet.
Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety.
Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States.
Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.Compare that to my opponent.
She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production.
Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.According to the Wall Street Journal, Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo."
19383,,1,"Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.The platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a price on carbon."""
19384,,1,"That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production a tax on American consumers.And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country often foreign countries not very friendly to us.That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.We need an America-First energy plan.This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy."
19385,,1,"The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.That means we will end the war on coal.I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.We will eliminate the highly-invasive ""Waters of the US"" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats."
19386,,1,"My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.We Will make America Wealthy Again.We Will make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again."
19387,,1,Thank you.
19388,,1,"It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees."
19389,,1,Tremendous polls keep coming in.
19390,,1,"A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.We will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.We will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs."
19391,,1,"The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor we will remove those restrictions day one.We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.President Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars."
19392,,1,"Instead, they surged $5,000.Our replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it."
19393,,1,"It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market they will be competing for your business.We're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks."
19394,,1,"High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.On trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization."
19395,,1,"Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.Our massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders."
19396,,1,"There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.Hillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.I am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been ""fighting for women."""
19397,,1,"That she has been ""fighting for children."
19398,,1,"Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty?
Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare?
You know the old saying, Watch what I do, not what I say."
19399,,1,"At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions.
I have employed thousands of women in my company.
Women of different backgrounds.
Women of many talents.And just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.
That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts.
Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.Families can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.We have also talked about improving education.
My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.We are also going to bring down the cost of college.Universities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students.
I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt.
This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers.
Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.Women also value security.
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use.
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs.
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use.
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders.
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.This must change.
Every change starts with a conversation.
Together, we will have this conversation.
And we will make this change.The changes will start immediately.Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy.
Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work.
Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas.
The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.By the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.We are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.Another major part of our agenda is safety.I believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.Today, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture.
We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.African-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.Many African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.At the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.I will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.That includes the new civil rights issue of our time  School Choice.Democrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.The jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.To those suffering, I say  Vote for Donald Trump.
What do you have to lose?
I will fix it.
I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.The policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.Of course, she got rich through it all the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.Worst of all, she put her public office up for sale and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.There's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign and not mine.
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.95% of our donors are small dollar donations.
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.
They're all part of the same political establishment.They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World.
I am running to be President of the United States.
I Am For America and America First.Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.Government will start working again.
Fixing things is what I do.
Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.That's what I want to do for our country I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be.
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.It used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint.
We'll turn it all around.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors.
You have to pick up that phone.
Go to our website to learn more.
You have to campaign on the streets.
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.You have 44 days until the big vote.
You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017 I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.And we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.
American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Hillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge.
It reads  I'm With Her."
19400,,1,"I have a different pledge  I'm With You the American People.To all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight  I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you.
I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad.
We are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.On November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.Lower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.I am an outsider fighting for you.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase  Follow The Money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks.
She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.We can't let that happen.
That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.The Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy they are donating to Hillary Clinton.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.
That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over this country.The American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways.
They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.How many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another?
They are the sordid past.
We are the bright future.While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.Never in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.This will be the year the American people say  Enough is enough.It's time for real change a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton they are too smart, and they know they are being used.
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over she never does, and that will never change.
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men super-predators."
19401,,1,"Same thing goes for Hispanic voters they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World.
I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?Why can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want?
Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?The answer is simple.
Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.These special interests control Hillary Clinton.
She is their chosen representative.
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase  Follow The Money.
She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.Look at her career.
She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.
She's failed at everything.
She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt.
She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.She failed upstate New York.She failed the inner cities.She's failed women and children.
I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent.
Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.And she has been a disaster on our borders.I'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.Hillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities.
Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.
Just Follow The Money.Her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors we're taking them on for YOU.
So you can have the future you want.That includes keeping your family safe.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.I will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations including on our farmers negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.
Remember  Follow the Money.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same political establishment.
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Government will start working again.
Fixing things is what I do.
Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.An article in the New York Post was published recently called How Donald Trump helped save New York City."
19402,,1,"The article said, quote  Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out… Trump   almost by force of will   rode to the rescue."
19403,,1,"Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead."
19404,,1,"That's what I want to do for our country I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th and it means you need to start voting early.
Early voting is so important.You have to knock on doors.
You have to pick up that phone.
You have to campaign on the streets.
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.

Thank you.
It's so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.
A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.I am an outsider fighting for you.One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country.
Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.This is a national crisis.Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police.
First, she calls our supporters many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters deplorable and irredeemable.Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of implicit bias,"" essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself."
19405,,1,"After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as ""super-predators."
19406,,1,"How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.The police officers she attacks are the same people of all colors and nationalities who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities.
We are going to save thousands of lives.The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities.
They don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens.
They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.I will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities.The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks.
Follow The Money.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton they are too smart, and they know they are being used.
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over she never does, and that will never change.Same thing goes for Hispanic voters they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.
There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours.
45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.The inner cities have been left behind.Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child.
To the African-American community, I say  what do you have to lose?
Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase  Follow The Money.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow The Money.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over this country.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office.
It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds.
She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.This will be the year the American people said  Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World.
I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.These special interests control Hillary Clinton.
She is their chosen representative.
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase  Follow The Money.
She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Look at her career.
She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.
She's failed at everything.
She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt.
She failed on ISIS in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.She failed upstate New York promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left.
All she did was name a post office and a highway.She failed the inner cities.She's failed women and children.The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors we're taking them on for YOU.
So you can have the future you want.I'm not owned or controlled by anyone my loyalty is to you, and no one else.
I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.
We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success  a great education, and a great job.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.Follow the Money.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same rigged political establishment.
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.
And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.Government will start working for you again.
Fixing things is what I do.
Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.That's what I want to do for our country I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th and it means you need to start voting early.
Early voting is already underway.You have to knock on doors.
You have to pick up that phone.
You have to campaign on the streets.
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.
Visit our website to find out how you can help.You have six weeks until the election.
You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.Don't let it slip away.
Don't let this chance go.
Stand up and be heard for your family, for your city, for your country.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017 I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.

Thank you.
It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.
I've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire.
You are strong, independent and you are free.We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for you.Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase  Follow The Money.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.Again, just follow the money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.
We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5.
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over this country.The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals.
They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.The Clintons are the sordid past.We are the bright future.While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.This will be the year the American people say  Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton they are too smart, and they know they are being used.
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over she never does, and that will never change.
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men super-predators."
19407,,1,"Same thing goes for Hispanic voters they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.We will unleash the power of American energy we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved.
You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership which would destroy manufacturing in this state.Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.I am not running to be President of the World.
I am running to be President of the United States of America.From now on, it's going to be America First.Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?Think about it.
For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed?
Or for our infrastructure to be repaired?
Or for the waste to be removed from the budget?
For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?All the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.The reason for this is simple.
It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.These special interests control Hillary Clinton.
She is their chosen representative.She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors we're taking them on for YOU.
So you can have the future you want.That includes keeping your family safe.New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.The failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country.
They just want me to go along with the status quo.Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.We will never back down from fighting to save American lives.That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism.
Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs.
New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border.
The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border that is a promise.The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment.
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have to knock on doors.
You have to pick up that phone.
You have to campaign on the streets.
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.

You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.

I am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.
In 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.It is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.We are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a depleted military.It is time to rebuild Detroit.
It is time to rebuild Michigan.
It is time to rebuild the United States of America.Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan.
These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit.
That's how she gets rich by taking your jobs and your money away from you.That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The deal she called the Gold Standard."""
19408,,1,"The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP and their wish is her command.These special interests pay her for speeches."
19409,,1,They pay her Foundation.
19410,,1,They pay her husband.
19411,,1,"In return, they GET YOUR JOBS."
19412,,1,"Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words  FOLLOW THE MONEY.Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions."
19413,,1,"Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it."
19414,,1,Her husband has talked it up.
19415,,1,"Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing  her donors.Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.On November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming  WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for you.Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.We are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.We have a movement."
19416,,1,The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us.
19417,,1,"The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.They don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.These Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.For decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders."
19418,,1,2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem and to hold our politicians accountable.
19419,,1,"If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system  show up and vote.When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them  you're fired.In their place, will be a new government."
19420,,1,"We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.We are going to do it together."
19421,,1,"In 39 days, everything is going to change.Now, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption."
19422,,1,"So we are going to spell it out for them today.The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy they are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.Follow the money.In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena."
19423,,1,"13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer."
19424,,1,"Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals."
19425,,1,Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.
19426,,1,"Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five."
19427,,1,"So here's my question for Hillary Clinton  can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama  will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?No one is above the law."
19428,,1,"Not even Hillary Clinton.Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power to keep their control over this country.Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals."
19429,,1,"They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.This will be the year the American people say  Enough is enough.Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities."
19430,,1,"I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton they are too smart, and they know they are being used."
19431,,1,"They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over she never does, and that will never change."
19432,,1,"Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men ""super-predators."
19433,,1,"To the African-American community, let me ask you this question  are you better off than you were eight years ago?
If not, vote for Donald Trump.
I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit.
Half of Detroit residents do not work.
Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty.
It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.We will unleash the power of American energy.The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan.
Today, that number is only 160,000.Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico.It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007.
She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive."""
19434,,1,"She pledged to reject the deal.But she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.Once installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a ""cutting-edge deal."""
19435,,1,"She rammed it through to adoption she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.The U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose."
19436,,1,"This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year."
19437,,1,"Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow."
19438,,1,"Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a ""global community of stakeholders."
19439,,1,"Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a global community."""
19440,,1,It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens.
19441,,1,Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.I am not running to be President of the World.
19442,,1,I am running to be President of the United States of America.Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?The reason for this is simple.
19443,,1,"It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal."
19444,,1,"And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors we're taking them on for YOU."
19445,,1,"So you can have the future you want.Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment."
19446,,1,"And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.Together, we can accomplish anything we want.But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.You have 39 days until the election."
19447,,1,"You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.American cars made in Michigan will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.American hands will rebuild this nation and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation."
19448,,1,"American workers will be hired to do the job.We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.To the people of Michigan, I promise you this –We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!"
19449,,1,This is such an amazing city.
19450,,1,"It's called ""Home of the Heroes,"" because of your proud tradition of military service."
19451,,1,Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients.
19452,,1,"As President Eisenhower said, there must be ""something in the water out there in Pueblo"" because ""all you guys turn out to be heroes."""
19453,,1,Colorado is home to six military bases.
19454,,1,We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military.Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing.
19455,,1,"We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment.One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy."
19456,,1,"Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas."
19457,,1,"We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work.I have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan –and the largest regulatory reform in American history."
19458,,1,"That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.Along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.I've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is."
19459,,1,"This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.It is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.It's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it."
19460,,1,"The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.Many so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time despite being a beneficiary.I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them and that is what I commit to doing.As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.I have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.As a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes  city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes."
19461,,1,"It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.The conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically and the business landscape changed with it  Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.Many business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive."
19462,,1,"Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work."
19463,,1,"Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.Yet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.That did not happen by chance or luck it happened by action, and talent.I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did."
19464,,1,"In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.Those who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties."
19465,,1,"People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling government favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow."
19466,,1,Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life or added a single dollar of value to the American economy.
19467,,1,"Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors for astronomical dollars and like never before."
19468,,1,"It's corruption of the highest order.While I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.By her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars without building a company, or creating a single thing of value."
19469,,1,"During the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back."
19470,,1,"They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.But, I never had any doubts and never gave up.That's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best."
19471,,1,"And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.Just look at what happened in the primary."
19472,,1,"Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.The reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight."
19473,,1,"That's what I am a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.With my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.That is why I am here today."
19474,,1,That is why I have left private business for public life because I understand our country is in very bad shape.
19475,,1,"And now our country is in need of a major comeback it needs one now more than ever.We owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits."
19476,,1,"In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.Our country is broke.We have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs."
19477,,1,"We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a monthly basis.This is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children."
19478,,1,And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren.
19479,,1,"But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around starting today.What I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.We cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.We can turn this all around but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW."
19480,,1,"The failed political establishment must go it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.In the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished."
19481,,1,Everybody said that I was done there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
19482,,1,They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.So they said I was finished.
19483,,1,"The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.I started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company."
19484,,1,"When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same but the value of the assets plummeted."
19485,,1,"But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.My understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.Now, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.The early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.These are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders."
19486,,1,"Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear  we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.These tough times were when I performed my very best."
19487,,1,"The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle."
19488,,1,I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win.
19489,,1,"That's the thinking we need for our country that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.Put me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you."
19490,,1,Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors.
19491,,1,I am here fighting for America.Many people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen I've proven that over and over again.That's what I do.
19492,,1,"When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done that's when I am just getting started.The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible."
19493,,1,"For me, impossible is just a starting point.From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs."
19494,,1,"Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.On November 8th, America's comeback begins and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.The people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.This is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state."
19495,,1,"Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing  You are all Americans.And, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American."
19496,,1,"Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things  safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.This is the change I will deliver."
19497,,1,Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure.
19498,,1,"Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home."
19499,,1,"She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.She opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools."
19500,,1,"We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it Obamacare is an absolute disaster."
19501,,1,"Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the ""Gold Standard."
19502,,1,"Colorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.But while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors.
She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests.
They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.
The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.To hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.
Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public.
She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals.
It's worse than Watergate.The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.We have become a Banana Republic.Now, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Let me repeat that  the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it by showing up and voting on November 8th.People have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.This is the year the American people say  Enough is Enough.The Clintons are the sordid past.
We are the bright future.Now, another issue I want to address today is immigration.
As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants.
It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.Illegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.We are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.We are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.Cases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.Or cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama and then released again after the killing.There are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out and we are going to get them out quickly.To the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you  your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.We also have to keep our country safe from terrorism.
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in Washington.Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia.
Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.Terrorists are infiltrating our country.Now, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the Middle East.I want to keep you and your family safe.My job is not to represent foreign countries.
My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.If you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.Immigration Security is National Security.Here are some more things we will do starting in 2017 –We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We are going to rebuild America.We are going to revitalize America.And we are going to unite America.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.Together, we will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.Thank you, and God Bless!
It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services.
Before we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.To truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.As President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.Cyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way.
The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter C"" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous."
19503,,1,"Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.Just consider some of these recent hacks JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.Identify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware involving the extortion of a hacked institution are all becoming increasingly common.Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government."
19504,,1,"It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.As President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense."
19505,,1,"I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks."
19506,,1,"This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability no matter how difficult to track down and incapacitate those responsible."
19507,,1,"We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law."
19508,,1,I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate.
19509,,1,"My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century."
19510,,1,Thank you.
19511,,1,I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.
19512,,1,"In 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.I am going to make America Rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.My economic agenda is very simple  jobs, jobs, jobs.I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight."
19513,,1,"The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past."
19514,,1,We are change she is four more years of Obama.Clinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place.
19515,,1,"To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything."
19516,,1,"In fact, she's just made things worse she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent."
19517,,1,"She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction."
19518,,1,"And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit."
19519,,1,Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did?
19520,,1,She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate.
19521,,1,"The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.I know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.I know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.I've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law."
19522,,1,"Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt."
19523,,1,"It doubled under President Obama.Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.The federal budget is a disaster."
19524,,1,"Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.We are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs or certainly not the jobs they want.Overseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.America needs a turnaround.America needs a comeback.America needs a change.That is why I am running.First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.The architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie he called it the ""stupidity of the American voter."""
19525,,1,But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.Do you remember all the lies?
19526,,1,"President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars."
19527,,1,"Instead, they surged $5,000.Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.He has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation."
19528,,1,"Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare ""one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country."
19529,,1,"Bill has a different view.
Here is what bill said He just said it's a crazy system,"" where people end up with ""premiums doubled and coverage cut in half."""
19530,,1,"He said ""it's the craziest thing in the world."
19531,,1,"Bill Clinton said people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies."""
19532,,1,"Clinton added that it ""doesn't make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn't work."
19533,,1,"I couldn't agree more.
Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.This is essential for Arizona.
Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.There is only 1 way to stop it  to vote for Trump.
Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.Next, we are going to unleash American energyI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.
Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Companies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.
Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.As the factories leave, our money leaves with them.
Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.A nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.A country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.A government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration.
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.
The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House.
He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home.
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.In California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.
Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot.
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in Washington.Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia.
Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.Hillary is for open borders.I am not running to be President of the world.
I am running to be President of the United States.
I am for America First.For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe.
The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end beginning in January of 2017.We are going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.
Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.
She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals.
It's worse than Watergate.The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.We have become a Banana Republic.Yesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it by sending in your ballots.We are also going to fix our inner cities45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more.
They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.
They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say  What do you have to lose?
Vote For Donald Trump.
I will fix it.To everyone in the country I say  what do you have to lose?We will have safe communities for EVERYONE.School choice for your children.Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.Everyone will be included in the American Dream.Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.We are going to rebuild America.We are going to revitalize America.And we are going to unite America.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.
You're going to remember this day.
We're going to make history.
This is a movement like you've never seen before.
We're going to make history together.You're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.You are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.
You are voting to believe in yourselves.
A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems.
It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.It's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.All together, we are going to –Make America wealthy again.We are going to make America strong again.We are going to make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you.
It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada a state where I have so many great friends and employees.
In 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?Mike did such an incredible job.
I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent.
Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.
In fact, she's just made things worse she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent.
She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.I am running to represent Americans and we are going to make America Rich again.I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.My economic agenda is very simple  jobs, jobs, jobs.The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt.
It doubled under President Obama.Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.Our police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.The federal budget is a disaster.
Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.We are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs or certainly not the jobs they want.Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.America needs a turnaround.America needs a comeback.America needs a change.That is why I am running.On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.That was a lie.He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars.
Instead, they surged $5,000.Another lie.Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation.
Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country."
19534,,1,"Bill has a different view.
Here is what bill said He just said it's a crazy system,"" and that ""it's the craziest thing in the world."
19535,,1,"Bill said people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies."""
19536,,1,"Clinton added that it ""doesn't make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn't work."
19537,,1,"On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.There is only one way to stop Obamacare  to vote for Trump.
The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th.
The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th.
And early voting begins on the 22nd.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.
Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.

Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.
Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the Gold Standard."""
19538,,1,"The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.I am an outsider fighting for YOU.We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals."
19539,,1,"We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent."
19540,,1,"On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.America will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root."

19547,,1,"The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists."

And early voting begins on the 22nd.With your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada.
Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right.
We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revivalMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words  jobs, jobs, jobs.But to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.
Too much is being made in other countries.When I am President, we will start making things in America again.Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.
Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.Since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.The jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country.
I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.It's going to be a new day in America.For too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.We will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.Thousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.Security begins at the border.Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.In fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.But she didn't do it.The ICE officers, who endorsed me their first endorsement of a candidate ever issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.Let me read from it.Again, this all a quote from the ICE officers  Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S."
19578,,1,history.
19579,,1,"Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S."
19580,,1,borders.
19581,,1,"Their quote continues.
She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees."
19582,,1,The ICE officers conclude by saying  Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.
19583,,1,"That whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers.
In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country as was the mall shooter in Washington State.The Boston Bombers were here on asylum.
The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia.
The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.I am not running to be President of the world.
I am running to be President of the United States.
I am for America First.We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We are also going to end the government corruptionHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.
Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.
She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.It's worse than Watergate.Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more.

The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.
This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.
The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes.
This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor.
We have to investigate the investigation.Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena and then destroyed her phones with a hammer all to cover-up her crimes.
People have gone to jail for doing far less.
She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along  Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty.
This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations .Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed serious concerns"" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti."
19584,,1,The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country.
19585,,1,"I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in."
19586,,1,"As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from ""Friends of Bill"" or ""William Jefferson Clinton VIPs"" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.People who were labeled ""Not Friends of Bill"" were placed on the sidelines.In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop."
19587,,1,And guess who set it up?
19588,,1,"Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.The company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.Today, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.To all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics."
19589,,1,This is deeply offensive.
19590,,1,It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans.
19591,,1,"We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform."
19592,,1,"She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.I'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.The emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton."
19593,,1,The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.To all the Bernie voters out there  don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton.
19594,,1,"A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and as confirmed by Wikileaks she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security .Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time."
19595,,1,The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign.
19596,,1,"It's just one more way the system is rigged.Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post, or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.The emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise."
19597,,1,The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories.
19598,,1,It's called corruption.The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders.
19599,,1,"Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed  ""from time to time I get the questions in advance."
19600,,1,"The media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment.
And they're all teamed up against you, the American people .On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more.
We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.I am asking all Americans Republicans, Independents and Democrats to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.
You're going to remember this day.
This is a movement like you've never seen before.
We're going to make history together.
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.
Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you everybody.
This is a big, big crowd, you know?
[ ] I'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here.
So, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right?
They're going to be more famous.
Look, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras?
Go ahead cameras.
They never do it.
They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media.
Look.
We love being here, I love being with you.
I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time.
In 27 days, we're going to win Florida  and we're going to win back the White House.
And that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening.
We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst.
We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime.
You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years.
You don't hear that from the press.
We're going to cut taxes big league.
Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes.
We're going to cut taxes and regulations.
We're going to reduce the costs of education.
By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local.
We're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time.
And when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before.
And we are going to once again put America first.
The deadline for voter register who is not registered?

If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK?
There's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register.
They just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand.

If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say.
Seriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room?
OK, all young people.

OK, right?
So go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country.
Also, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary.
So, register, request a ballot.Thank you.
I love you.
I love you, too.The Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on?
Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.
The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it.
She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office.
And I don't think it would be close.
The WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this?
to the Clinton campaign.So think of this.
The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.
He was gonna play golf.
It was 110 degrees.But he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids.
He was there for 39 minutes.
I think most of us know what happened.
So fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes.
Now, did you ever hear  Did you ever hear anything like this?
And, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this.
They don't talk about this.
Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story.
Here you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview.
Folks, this is out of control.And the FBI unbelievable people.
You have incredible people in the FBI.
I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.
I would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night.These are great people.
These are great Americans.
And they can't believe what's going on.This corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor.
Our country has never been so low.
In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.
But look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena.
But we have to also remember this remember this.
This is maybe in a sense even more important.
We have to investigate the investigation.
We have to investigate the investigation.
We've never had a case like this.
And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.
Normally, Congress you know she lied to Congress.
She lied to the FBI.
And remember, he said she was negligent.
She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.
Remember, she said, I never said gold standard.
And remember when I said line in the sand?
She said, I wasn't secretary of state.
I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.
But think of this.
Think of this.
There's never been a time like this in our country.
And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them.
I am so disappointed in Congress.
I am so disappointed.
And I mean both sides.
I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody.
To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level.
She shouldn't be allowed to run for president.
You know that.
Other people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did.
You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell.
You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated.
Took pictures of a submarine.
And you take a look at this.
So we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen.
They don't know what to do.
Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department.
But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do.
Now, they do make laws.
Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this.
But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.
But all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it?
We have never been in a position like this.
I'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington?
Maybe that's it.
I really believe it.
I really believe it.
I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone.
Do they make deals like this?
This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States.
We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again.
And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?
Folks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you.
Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails.
And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing?
They were missing.
So she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them.
By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world.
They never even heard of it.
They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them.
They don't want them.
They don't want to get them.
I have a feeling.
So then she did this after, not before.
Before would be bad.
She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.Now, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail.
Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember?
for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails.
And then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.And what about her law firm?
You know what?
She's using a phenomenal law firm.
I know the firm.
Phenomenal law firm.
They're the ones that did all this stuff.
Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related.
You can't do that.
If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them.
It's a law firm nobody ever mentions.
The law firm is unbelievable.
It's very powerful.
OK?
Obviously, they've done a great job.
But that law firm should be implicated in this crime.
OK?
They're the ones they got rid of all this stuff.
The law firm got rid of all this stuff.
And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime.
They are not supposed to say, Oh, we got rid of most of it."""
19601,,1,"That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that."
19602,,1,It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.
19603,,1,"So then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes."
19604,,1,"Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer?"
19605,,1,Has any please raise your hand?
19606,,1,Please.
19607,,1,One.
19608,,1,What business are you in?
19609,,1,I see two hands.
19610,,1,"We have 15,000."
19611,,1,Two hands.
19612,,1,Anybody else?
19613,,1,It is so disgraceful.
19614,,1,It's so embarrassing.
19615,,1,"And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff."
19616,,1,The press hardly reports it.
19617,,1,They hardly report it.
19618,,1,"She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics."
19619,,1,She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.
19620,,1,And they hardly report it.
19621,,1,"While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion."
19622,,1,Does anyone know that?
19623,,1,No.
19624,,1,How do you lose $6 billion?
19625,,1,"Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, ""serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department."""
19626,,1,Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption.
19627,,1,"It's corruption Whitewater, cattle."
19628,,1,Never is with these people.
19629,,1,Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember.
19630,,1,Remember the cattle?
19631,,1,"She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals?"
19632,,1,"And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff."
19633,,1,"They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that."
19634,,1,"It's corruption, folks."
19635,,1,It's corruption.
19636,,1,"They understood that, by the way."
19637,,1,"They're smart, they got it very quickly.This will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough."
19638,,1,"During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing."
19639,,1,"And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing."
19640,,1,These are not fans of Clinton.
19641,,1,"That, I can tell you."
19642,,1,They despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people.
19643,,1,"New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in."
19644,,1,They kept cashing in.
19645,,1,"As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines."
19646,,1,And remember this.
19647,,1,"Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony."
19648,,1,Tony.
19649,,1,Anybody want to hire Tony?
19650,,1,"He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti."
19651,,1,It's so bad.
19652,,1,"Look, we're in a rigged system, folks."
19653,,1,"This is a rigged, rigged system."
19654,,1,You saw so many of the things.
19655,,1,"I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable."
19656,,1,It tells you the inner heart you got to read it.
19657,,1,"And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out."
19658,,1,"They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing."
19659,,1,She'd be nothing.
19660,,1,Zero.
19661,,1,"And by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes?"
19662,,1,So they had nine online polls.
19663,,1,"Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20."
19664,,1,"Time Magazine had like a massive look, ""Time Magazine"" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much."
19665,,1,"Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines."
19666,,1,"But ""Time Magazine"" it was total destruction."
19667,,1,"And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate?"
19668,,1,"People go, yes, yes."
19669,,1,Did we beat her or what?
19670,,1,I look so forward I do.
19671,,1,"I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.As Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time."
19672,,1,To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people.
19673,,1,"I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible."
19674,,1,"They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart."
19675,,1,"But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me."
19676,,1,And it arrives on November 8.
19677,,1,"November 8, get out and vote.The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals."
19678,,1,They attacked Catholics and evangelicals.
19679,,1,Viciously.
19680,,1,And that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters.
19681,,1,Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you.
19682,,1,I really do believe it.
19683,,1,And in all of the primaries you saw that.
19684,,1,I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals.
19685,,1,They're incredible people.
19686,,1,Remember the Johnson Amendment.
19687,,1,We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment.
19688,,1,Just remember that.
19689,,1,These emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans.
19690,,1,True.
19691,,1,"The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile."
19692,,1,Smile Hillary.
19693,,1,Smile.
19694,,1,"Hey folks, we have to get back to work."
19695,,1,Our country's in trouble.
19696,,1,We can't play games anymore.
19697,,1,Smile.
19698,,1,You believe it?
19699,,1,Smile.
19700,,1,"And how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that."
19701,,1,I'll tell you.
19702,,1,"It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things."
19703,,1,"Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place."
19704,,1,How about that?
19705,,1,I'll tell you what.
19706,,1,"Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me?"
19707,,1,"Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well."
19708,,1,"Hillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable."
19709,,1,"I actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know."
19710,,1,I'm the only one.
19711,,1,Deplorable and irredeemable.
19712,,1,"Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back."
19713,,1,"I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again."
19714,,1,And it's hot as hell in here but I don't care.
19715,,1,"Call it Florida, right?"
19716,,1,Florida.
19717,,1,Emails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate.
19718,,1,"Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that?"
19719,,1,Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate.
19720,,1,I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets.
19721,,1,"And we still beat her badly, right?"
19722,,1,So I mean what's the big deal?
19723,,1,But I want information.
19724,,1,The Republicans are not doing their job.
19725,,1,They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.
19726,,1,This all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.He made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation.
19727,,1,"But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.So all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people."
19728,,1,We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.
19729,,1,"And by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that?"
19730,,1,That's a lot of money.
19731,,1,"And I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money."
19732,,1,"If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida."
19733,,1,"I'll still love you, I think."
19734,,1,Maybe not.
19735,,1,"You know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose."
19736,,1,You have done the single greatest job.
19737,,1,nobody's ever done a thing like this before.
19738,,1,No matter where we go it's like this.
19739,,1,"But   They said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen."
19740,,1,"I said, wait a minute, you're wrong."
19741,,1,"If I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted."
19742,,1,"We're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out."
19743,,1,A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions.
19744,,1,What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?
19745,,1,"More Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals."
19746,,1,"And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits."
19747,,1,You didn't see that.
19748,,1,See?
19749,,1,And I'm not going to.
19750,,1,The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security.
19751,,1,"And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live."
19752,,1,We're live.
19753,,1,Amazing.
19754,,1,I think they are just turning them all off now.
19755,,1,Watch.
19756,,1,"You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly?A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes."
19757,,1,"Big, big tax decrease."
19758,,1,We're going to lower your taxes.
19759,,1,"WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time."
19760,,1,The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign.
19761,,1,It's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged.
19762,,1,And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.
19763,,1,"And my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong!"
19764,,1,"How do you win a state and you get less delegates?And I said, this system is rigged!"
19765,,1,"And it was, but we figured out how to win, right?"
19766,,1,That's what you need.
19767,,1,Won in a landslide.
19768,,1,I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system  By far.
19769,,1,Wasn't even close.
19770,,1,"Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine."
19771,,1,That's the Clinton machine.
19772,,1,"The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did."
19773,,1,"And this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight."
19774,,1,"This guy who came out, he was shaking."
19775,,1,"He was so nervous.He asked me the first question, ""Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?"""
19776,,1,What a lightweight.
19777,,1,They shoulda fired him for what he did.John Harwood.
19778,,1,"I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise."
19779,,1,The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written.
19780,,1,"Nobody ever called me and said, ""Hi, Mr. Trump."
19781,,1,We wrote a story.
19782,,1,Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback.
19783,,1,"Would you like us to take anything out?"""
19784,,1,This system is so rigged.
19785,,1,"Now, this is all down in the e-mails."
19786,,1,She had veto power over what she said.I'll tell you what.
19787,,1,"I want to have that, too."
19788,,1,"I want to have veto power.I used to get such good publicity, folks."
19789,,1,"Now, I mean it's like it's incredible."
19790,,1,I used to get my life was so simple.My life was so simple.
19791,,1,"I had a beautiful, simple life."
19792,,1,It was going.I built an unbelievable company.
19793,,1,"And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex.You know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now."
19794,,1,And now they have two and sometimes three jobs.
19795,,1,"In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less."
19796,,1,Not a good not a good assemblage of facts.
19797,,1,Here's the only good news.
19798,,1,I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before.OK?
19799,,1,That I can tell you.
19800,,1,Including being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature.
19801,,1,Which is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight.
19802,,1,I mean why you can't be.
19803,,1,"You go home, you say, ""I feel great."
19804,,1,"I lost a lot of weight."""
19805,,1,"By the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks."
19806,,1,"Oh, what a joke what a total joke."
19807,,1,Our country's in such trouble.
19808,,1,"That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous.The corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it."
19809,,1,"We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people."
19810,,1,"We're gonna do it, too."
19811,,1,"The e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama."
19812,,1,"From the Middle East, come right in."
19813,,1,Come right in.
19814,,1,"550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent."
19815,,1,He doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
19816,,1,And why is he campaigning?
19817,,1,We just had a horrible jobs report.
19818,,1,We have no growth.
19819,,1,You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth.
19820,,1,We have a horrible jobs report.
19821,,1,China is ripping us off.
19822,,1,Japan is ripping us off with the cars.
19823,,1,"Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico."
19824,,1,"And China, and Vietnam, and everybody."
19825,,1,"Last year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion."
19826,,1,$800 billion.
19827,,1,Who the hell negotiates these deals?
19828,,1,"I mean, can you believe it?"
19829,,1,"So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton?"
19830,,1,"He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time."
19831,,1,He ought to be out in the White House.
19832,,1,He's not there long.
19833,,1,"He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person."
19834,,1,"Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders."
19835,,1,600 million people could pour into the United States.
19836,,1,You'll have nothing left.
19837,,1,"Tell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast."
19838,,1,"Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America."
19839,,1,This all came out.
19840,,1,She said she wants to dissolve the borders.
19841,,1,"And here I am saying, we want strong borders."
19842,,1,We don't want drugs coming in.
19843,,1,We don't want crime coming in.
19844,,1,"I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time."
19845,,1,Am I wasting my time?
19846,,1,I don't think so.
19847,,1,She doesn't want to have any borders.
19848,,1,"Total amnesty tell you what, folks."
19849,,1,This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country.
19850,,1,It's not going to happen.
19851,,1,You won't be able to.
19852,,1,The numbers will be too great.
19853,,1,"Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people."
19854,,1,"They're not putting their weight behind the people Instead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job."
19855,,1,"You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it I'm not bragging, I'm just saying maybe a little bit, but here he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics."
19856,,1,"So wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going?"
19857,,1,In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country.
19858,,1,"So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don."
19859,,1,"Let's go, let's beat this crook."
19860,,1,She's a crook.
19861,,1,Let's beat her.
19862,,1,We got to stop it.
19863,,1,"No, he doesn't do that."
19864,,1,There's a whole deal going on there.
19865,,1,"I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out."
19866,,1,I always figure things out.
19867,,1,But there's a whole sinister deal going on.
19868,,1,Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us.
19869,,1,Our great founders are spinning in their graves.
19870,,1,"Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals."
19871,,1,"They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump."
19872,,1,Two hundred.
19873,,1,Over 200.
19874,,1,Twenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump.
19875,,1,"I'll tell you, you know what I like?"
19876,,1,"Very smart, tough people like me."
19877,,1,I like that.
19878,,1,"The smart, tough people, they like Trump."
19879,,1,"American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government."
19880,,1,And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.
19881,,1,We're going to make great deals with other countries.
19882,,1,We're going to bring jobs back.
19883,,1,We're going to bring jobs back.
19884,,1,I'm not running to be president of the world.
19885,,1,I'm running to be president of the United States of America.
19886,,1,"Oh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it."
19887,,1,"You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd."
19888,,1,You can't imitate that noise.
19889,,1,We will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States.
19890,,1,"It's going to be America first, America first, America first."
19891,,1,"And yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change."
19892,,1,"Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards?"
19893,,1,I'm a believer in the environment.
19894,,1,It's got to be within reason.
19895,,1,I'm a believer.
19896,,1,"Here's what I want, though."
19897,,1,I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air.
19898,,1,That's what I want.
19899,,1,That's called climate change.
19900,,1,That's called environmental protection  But Hillary had this deal.
19901,,1,"Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had."
19902,,1,You know what she's got?
19903,,1,Like a tiny little fraction.
19904,,1,"Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday."
19905,,1,"She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy."
19906,,1,I don't know what the hell happened to him.
19907,,1,What happened to him?
19908,,1,"She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today."
19909,,1,Not nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us.
19910,,1,"No, no that's no problem."
19911,,1,Climate change is our problem.
19912,,1,"I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks."
19913,,1,"If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do."
19914,,1,I don't know.
19915,,1,"No, no can you imagine?"
19916,,1,"Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look."
19917,,1,"Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having and I kiddingly."
19918,,1,"But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something."
19919,,1,When they pulled out of Iraq the way they we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.
19920,,1,But we should have never been in Iraq.
19921,,1,"But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind."
19922,,1,And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed.
19923,,1,"Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched."
19924,,1,Couldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work.
19925,,1,"But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting."
19926,,1,"Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it."
19927,,1,"And I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question."
19928,,1,"Let me and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton."
19929,,1,Did you know that?
19930,,1,I just found that out.
19931,,1,The head guy worked for Bill Clinton.
19932,,1,What a rigged deal this is.
19933,,1,But here's the story.
19934,,1,"I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none."
19935,,1,It sounds good.
19936,,1,"Presidential commission, give me a break."
19937,,1,That's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day.
19938,,1,So happy.
19939,,1,Because we're dealing against a very dishonest system.
19940,,1,"But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration."
19941,,1,She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in.
19942,,1,"Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement."
19943,,1,"Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job."
19944,,1,"These are people that frankly, would work a lot less."
19945,,1,I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them.
19946,,1,"ICE, these are great people."
19947,,1,"Tough people, smart people."
19948,,1,"First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me."
19949,,1,And one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens.
19950,,1,"In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally."
19951,,1,"The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth."
19952,,1,"And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them."
19953,,1,Because they're smart.
19954,,1,They don't want them.
19955,,1,So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society.
19956,,1,"I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that."
19957,,1,"One convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl."
19958,,1,"The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries."
19959,,1,"She'll protect those borders, but not our borders."
19960,,1,"Casey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today."
19961,,1,"Jamiel Shaw has a son had a son, a great young man, killed violently."
19962,,1,"And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here."
19963,,1,And you have you have case after case after case.
19964,,1,We're not going to have it anymore.
19965,,1,We're not going to be the stupid people anymore.
19966,,1,"We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore."
19967,,1,"A Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today."
19968,,1,"We will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent."
19969,,1,Are you ready?
19970,,1,Are you ready?
19971,,1,"And who is going to pay for the wall?Audience  ""Mexico""100 percent."
19972,,1,They just don't know it yet.
19973,,1,"They don't know it yet, but 100 percent."
19974,,1,"They'll pay for the wall.Hey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect."
19975,,1,They're going to make less and they're going to like us more.
19976,,1,"Funny how that works, but it's true."
19977,,1,Mexico is making a fortune with trade.
19978,,1,They're taking our jobs.
19979,,1,So many things.
19980,,1,They are going to respect us finally.
19981,,1,We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country.
19982,,1,Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths.
19983,,1,Think of that think if you have a child 470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007.
19984,,1,Think of that.
19985,,1,Think of your kids and your grandkids.
19986,,1,We're going to stop it.
19987,,1,And most of it's coming across the southern border.
19988,,1,"And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally."
19989,,1,We will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others.
19990,,1,"But I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels  Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered."
19991,,1,Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees.
19992,,1,We don't know anything about them.
19993,,1,"This, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate she knows it they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program."
19994,,1,"So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands."
19995,,1,We can't let it happen.
19996,,1,"And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share."
19997,,1,"Believe me, they're not."
19998,,1,"They have plenty of money, they'll pay."
19999,,1,We can't pay.
20000,,1,We owe $20 trillion.
20001,,1,"20 trillion, doubled during Obama years."
20002,,1,Doubled.
20003,,1,He doubled the debt during his years.
20004,,1,"In fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country."
20005,,1,"There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states."
20006,,1,A record.
20007,,1,"Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools."
20008,,1,So let me state this clearly as I can.
20009,,1,I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
20010,,1,She won't even use the word.
20011,,1,She won't even use the term.
20012,,1,Our incompetent president I call him our campaign president our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
20013,,1,He won't use it.
20014,,1,He tries to explain it.
20015,,1,He spends hours trying to explain why.
20016,,1,"If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it."
20017,,1,It's only getting worse.
20018,,1,"And remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS."
20019,,1,"Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right."
20020,,1,You know why he does that?
20021,,1,Because he likes disturbing all of you.
20022,,1,He calls ISIL.
20023,,1,"But we started off, we had no ISIS."
20024,,1,"And now, 7 1/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries."
20025,,1,And she's going to get rid of them?
20026,,1,I can tell you this.
20027,,1,"They are hoping and they are praying they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world."
20028,,1,"They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me."
20029,,1,They are hoping.
20030,,1,"And by the way, she likes to say, they want me I will be their worst nightmare."
20031,,1,I'm going to be their worst nightmare.
20032,,1,And she lied during the debate.
20033,,1,"Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right?"
20034,,1,"She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy."
20035,,1,She was there when they drew the line.
20036,,1,"I walked out, they said, you know, she was there."
20037,,1,"Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't."
20038,,1,She was there.
20039,,1,It turned out to be a lie.
20040,,1,And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that.
20041,,1,She lied about many things.She put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.
20042,,1,"You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash."
20043,,1,"You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is."
20044,,1,"She gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies."
20045,,1,"And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us."
20046,,1,Now they're emboldened.You see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy.
20047,,1,"Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya."
20048,,1,You see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters.
20049,,1,"And instead of saying nicely, ""Hey, listen."
20050,,1,"You gotta be over there a little bit"", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right."
20051,,1,And the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day.
20052,,1,So stupid they're not.And when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other.
20053,,1,You saw that?
20054,,1,"Their jet fighters.Right, you saw that?"
20055,,1,"And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia.You ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia."
20056,,1,Russia did it.
20057,,1,They have no idea.
20058,,1,We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.
20059,,1,They have people.
20060,,1,"But they always blame Russia and then they say, ""Donald Trump is friends with Putin."
20061,,1,"I don't know Putin, folks.
I promise.
I don't know Putin.What the hell do I have to do with Putin?
These people are professional con people.
They're con.And this country can't have it.
This country can't have it.
And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right.You know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing.
You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by.
They took over - yeah, they took over.You look at Ukraine.
They took over during - that was Crimea.
They took that over during Obama's reign.You know, tough Obama.
He's so tough.
He's so tough.So, look, we need competence and we need it fast.
Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare.How about Libya?
How about Benghazi?
How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.
The only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back.
A Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS.
We're also going to build up our cyber defenses.
Cyber's a big thing.
And keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe.
And the word keep"" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it."
20062,,1,It's a mess.
20063,,1,"Show Less TextIt's so old, it's falling apart."
20064,,1,"And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online.ISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it."
20065,,1,And we're the ones that came up with it.
20066,,1,"At the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military."
20067,,1,We're going to take care of our people.
20068,,1,And that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind.
20069,,1,"When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words  peace through strength."
20070,,1,We don't want to use the military.
20071,,1,But it's got to be there.
20072,,1,"And just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again."
20073,,1,We're a debtor nation.
20074,,1,We're poor.
20075,,1,I'm going to make America rich again.
20076,,1,My enemy our enemies are unbelievable.
20077,,1,They love what's happening to our country.
20078,,1,They love it.

20081,,1,We're going to have clean coal.
20082,,1,We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.
20083,,1,We also have to repeal and replace it.
20084,,1,We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business.
20085,,1,Repeal and replace Obamacare.
20086,,1,"Bill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."
20087,,1,What kind of a system is this?
20088,,1,"Oh, did he suffer that evening."
20089,,1,"He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill."
20090,,1,He suffered.
20091,,1,"You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding."
20092,,1,He was only kidding.
20093,,1,It's a disaster.
20094,,1,"Obamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent."
20095,,1,In Texas they had 71 percent.
20096,,1,"In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse."
20097,,1,"We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money."
20098,,1,"As you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from."
20099,,1,Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.
20100,,1,"This is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote."
20101,,1,"At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals."
20102,,1,"When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part."
20103,,1,"And then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs."
20104,,1,All of our lost manufacturing.
20105,,1,We're going to get it back.
20106,,1,We're bringing our jobs back.
20107,,1,"When countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries."
20108,,1,All of these everyone.
20109,,1,We are not going to allow it to happen.
20110,,1,We are not going to allow it.
20111,,1,"We are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences."
20112,,1,The states are not going to put up with it anymore.
20113,,1,Our federal government is going to help.
20114,,1,We've built other countries at our expense.
20115,,1,We have.

20117,,1,"And they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me.And they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment."
20118,,1,Not going to happen.
20119,,1,"We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States  And if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money."
20120,,1,We are going to rebuild our country.
20121,,1,Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again.
20122,,1,"We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals."

20131,,1,God bless you.
20132,,1,Thank you.
20133,,1,Thank you.
20134,,1,I am so happy to be back here in Columbus.
20135,,1,Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail.
20136,,1,"And remind your friends and family to do the same.We are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.And we've only begun to fight.If we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans."
20137,,1,"We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.We are the campaign of change.We will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.I've wanted this race to be about the issues."
20138,,1,But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues.
20139,,1,"They only place they want to go is the gutter.So they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.In an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused."
20140,,1,"It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.I want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.Right now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.The greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media."
20141,,1,"The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same they collaborate and conspire together.This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.These are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.These are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.These are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens."
20142,,1,"Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.These are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.These are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.The political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.At the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine."
20143,,1,"They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors including foreign government and foreign actors.Hillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.She ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.She defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for ""open borders."""
20144,,1,"That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.We won't let it happen.Hillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.Under a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.Under President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country."
20145,,1,"It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.The new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.Yet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.The share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.In a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.First, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.Tuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.In all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.Students should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.That is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%."
20146,,1,"And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.That's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.Every American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.In addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition."
20147,,1,"If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.Some schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.We want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves."
20148,,1,They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.Much of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats.
20149,,1,"According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.Federal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat."
20150,,1,"Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.As president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.I will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus."
20151,,1,"In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.We will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.We also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career."
20152,,1,We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them.
20153,,1,"And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.I will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.There is a lot of room for improvement in this regard."
20154,,1,"Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications."
20155,,1,"I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.We also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried."
20156,,1,One of the biggest threats is outsourcing jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries.
20157,,1,"At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.We will protect these jobs for Americans.My economic plan including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.This includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.Finally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.Together, we are going to make America great again."
20158,,1,"Thank you, it is so great to be here in Florida."
20159,,1,"In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason  to protect and enrich itself.The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election."
20160,,1,"As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.This is not simply another 4-year election."
20161,,1,"This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry."
20162,,1,"The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world."
20163,,1,"Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent."
20164,,1,"Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago and yet they are working harder.It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country."
20165,,1,"They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure."
20166,,1,"We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates."
20167,,1,Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times.
20168,,1,"And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before and we won't let them do that.The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media."
20169,,1,Let's be clear on one thing  the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
20170,,1,"They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda."
20171,,1,"And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.For them, it is a war and for them, nothing is out of bounds.This is a struggle for the survival of our nation."
20172,,1,"This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known."
20173,,1,"Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed."
20174,,1,"They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation."
20175,,1,"And they will lie, lie and lie even more.The Clintons are criminals."
20176,,1,"This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power."
20177,,1,"Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine including 2,000 more emails this morningThese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false and the Clinton Machine knows it is."
20178,,1,It's all fabricated.
20179,,1,It's pure fiction and outright lies.
20180,,1,These events never happened.
20181,,1,"The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time."
20182,,1,"These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited."
20183,,1,"The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.What's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine and that magazine should be put out of business.Six months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately."
20184,,1,"She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times."
20185,,1,It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them.
20186,,1,"Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.Also, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary."
20187,,1,"The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances."
20188,,1,"I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago?"
20189,,1,"I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year."
20190,,1,Take a look at her words.
20191,,1,It would have been the headline.
20192,,1,"No, it only appears 26 days before the election.This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.This weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years."
20193,,1,But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them.
20194,,1,"Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.This is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.But let me state this as clearly as I can."
20195,,1,These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies.
20196,,1,They are false and slanderous in every respect.
20197,,1,We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime indeed one the most important elections in modern history and the polls show us in a dead heat.
20198,,1,"And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.So now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense."
20199,,1,"Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in."
20200,,1,I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics.
20201,,1,"I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.But I take all of these slings and arrows for you."
20202,,1,"I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.Their financial resources are unlimited."
20203,,1,Their political resources are unlimited.
20204,,1,Their media resources are unlimited.
20205,,1,"And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.Our political establishment has no soul.I knew these false attacks would come."
20206,,1,I knew this day would arrive.
20207,,1,And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you.
20208,,1,The only force strong enough to save this country is you.
20209,,1,"The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States in the back of her airplane, while on the runway for 39 minutes to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions."
20210,,1,"Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.I didn't need to do this."
20211,,1,"I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life."
20212,,1,"I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks."
20213,,1,"I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell."
20214,,1,"But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else and I know what's like to be an insider."
20215,,1,Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam.
20216,,1,"Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it."
20217,,1,"I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise."
20218,,1,"They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you."
20219,,1,"The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person which is what our country needs will ever again run for this office.I will not lie to you."
20220,,1,These false attacks hurt.
20221,,1,"To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words."
20222,,1,"It is reprehensible beyond description.But I also know, it's not about me it's about all of you."
20223,,1,"It's about all of us, together, as a country.It's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans."
20224,,1,"This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton."
20225,,1,"They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back."
20226,,1,"I will deliver.This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.We will vote for the country we want.We will vote for the future we want.We will vote for the politics we want.We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business."
20227,,1,"We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation."
20228,,1,"We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country and the disenfranchisement of our people.Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th."
20229,,1,"Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people."
20230,,1,Thank you.
20231,,1,"In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration."
20232,,1,Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
20233,,1,Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
20234,,1,Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption.
20235,,1,"Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes."
20236,,1,"The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them."
20237,,1,"The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election."
20238,,1,"The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it."
20239,,1,We are not going to back down.
20240,,1,We are not going to let it happen.
20241,,1,"We are just getting started.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption."
20242,,1,"They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.This will finally be the year the American people say  Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders."
20243,,1,"By open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders."
20244,,1,"And yes, we will build a wall.A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities."
20245,,1,"I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.We have to solve this crisis.I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other."
20246,,1,"Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories."
20247,,1,"Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system."
20248,,1,"Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction."
20249,,1,We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs.
20250,,1,"And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives."
20251,,1,"We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act."
20252,,1,This legislation is an important step.I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment.
20253,,1,"These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration."
20254,,1,"Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, FiatChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA."
20255,,1,"If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.We are going to start making things in America again.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.We will lower taxes massively on all Americans Hillary will raise your taxes massively.We will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life."
20256,,1,You're going to remember this day.
20257,,1,This is a movement like you've never seen before.
20258,,1,We're going to make history together.
20259,,1,"You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again."
20260,,1,Thank you.
20261,,1,"In 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House.Make sure to get your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.We are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration."
20262,,1,Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
20263,,1,Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
20264,,1,Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration.
20265,,1,"Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs her private position then lies to you, the public, with her public position."
20266,,1,"It's all a fraud.Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes."
20267,,1,"The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them."
20268,,1,"The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election."
20269,,1,"The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it."
20270,,1,We are not going to back down.
20271,,1,"We are not going to let it happen.We have only just begun to fight.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption."
20272,,1,"This will finally be the year the American people say  Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders."""
20273,,1,"Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.By ""open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism within our shores."
20274,,1,She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.So let me state this as clearly as I can.
20275,,1,If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.
20276,,1,"And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl."
20277,,1,"In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home."
20278,,1,"He left her on the side of a dirt road.What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back."
20279,,1,"Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.A wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis."
20280,,1,"My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.But, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.When I am President, everything will change."
20281,,1,We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls.
20282,,1,We will end our chronic trade deficits.
20283,,1,"We will start growing again.We'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA."

20285,,1,"Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.Reagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth."
20286,,1,"My economic reforms on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade."
20287,,1,"It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.President Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new ""National Monument."""
20288,,1,"No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector."
20289,,1,No approval by Congress.
20290,,1,Your state legislature opposed it.
20291,,1,It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good.
20292,,1,Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.But we are going to turn it all around.
20293,,1,"America's comeback begins on November 8th.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty."
20294,,1,"I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors.I'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life."

20300,,1,"In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration."
20301,,1,Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
20302,,1,Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
20303,,1,Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes.
20304,,1,"The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server."
20305,,1,"In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.This is a criminal conspiracy a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information that was classified."
20306,,1,"Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.But it gets even worse.The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a ""quid pro quo."""
20307,,1,This is felony corruption.
20308,,1,"Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.This is magnitudes worse than Watergate."
20309,,1,And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.But there's still more.
20310,,1,Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists.
20311,,1,"One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, ""take the money!!"""
20312,,1,with two exclamation points.
20313,,1,"This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.Remember, we are competing in a rigged election the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters."
20314,,1,"The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton."
20315,,1,"They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.The following comes straight from Pew Research.QUOTE  ""Approximately 24 million one of every eight voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate."
20316,,1,QUOTE  More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.
20317,,1,QUOTE  Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.
20318,,1,"Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting.
The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post.
The article was entitled  could non-citizens decide the November election?"""
20319,,1,"Here are some excerpts.QUOTE  ""More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote."
20320,,1,"QUOTE  Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections."
20321,,1,Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.
20322,,1,It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina.
20323,,1,"Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin."
20324,,1,"Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.We will not let that happen.It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave.
But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do he rigged the system on his way out.
Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.So, here is what I am announcing tonight.
First  I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service.
I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.Second  I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third  I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth  I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.And Fifth  I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words  jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.The list goes on and on.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders."
20325,,1,"By open trade,"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By ""open borders,"" she means totally unlimited immigration.In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are ""Un-American."
20326,,1,"So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can.
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.
And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.The ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S.
history."
20327,,1,"Here is a summary of the Hillary plan --Support for Sanctuary Cities--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens--Obamacare for illegal immigrants--No deportation of visa overstays--Expanding catch-and-release on the border--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives--A 550% increase in Syrian refugeesEither we win this election, or we lose the country.Under a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty."
20328,,1,"I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life."
20329,,1,You're going to remember this day.
20330,,1,This is a movement like you've never seen before.
20331,,1,"You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again."
20332,,1,"In 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House."
20333,,1,We're going to take it back.
20334,,1,"[ ] And while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day."
20335,,1,"Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in."
20336,,1,"But get there, November 8th."
20337,,1,"I'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well."
20338,,1,"One of the most beautiful places, by the way."
20339,,1,"We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy."
20340,,1,Good place.
20341,,1,"I've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart."
20342,,1,"They love their airplanes, that I can tell you."
20343,,1,The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again.
20344,,1,Great people.
20345,,1,"Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first."
20346,,1,You don't hear that term very much.
20347,,1,"We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we?"
20348,,1,"America first, right?"
20349,,1,"If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you."
20350,,1,Believe me.
20351,,1,"We're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.  We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations."
20352,,1,"Unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth."
20353,,1,We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
20354,,1,And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
20355,,1,Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration.
20356,,1,Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration.
20357,,1,Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration.
20358,,1,"Your country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country."
20359,,1,We have to help our country.
20360,,1,It is under siege in so many ways.
20361,,1,"By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure."
20362,,1,Very dishonest.
20363,,1,Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration.
20364,,1,They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in.
20365,,1,"Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation."
20366,,1,"You look at our jobs report, a disaster."
20367,,1,"Last week a jobs report, total disaster."
20368,,1,"Look at our GNP, total disaster."
20369,,1,"Under my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent."
20370,,1,"Right now, we're at about 1 percent."
20371,,1,China's at 7 percent.
20372,,1,India's at 8 percent.
20373,,1,"We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me."
20374,,1,That I can tell you.
20375,,1,We're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years.
20376,,1,"And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them."
20377,,1,The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC.
20378,,1,"And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here?"
20379,,1,"Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest."
20380,,1,"And yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media."
20381,,1,But it's all over the media.
20382,,1,They were busted.
20383,,1,"They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies."
20384,,1,"And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night."
20385,,1,We had people stand up for no reason.
20386,,1,"It's like, what are they doing here?"
20387,,1,"And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media."
20388,,1,So bad.
20389,,1,We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people.
20390,,1,Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency.
20391,,1,She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done.
20392,,1,I'll tell you.
20393,,1,It's true.
20394,,1,"Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes."
20395,,1,"The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server."
20396,,1,It's hard to believe.
20397,,1,"And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens."
20398,,1,"In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access."
20399,,1,"The FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo."
20400,,1,Not allowed to do it.
20401,,1,This is a felony corruption.
20402,,1,"Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign."
20403,,1,"The media barely covers this event, by the way."
20404,,1,This is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it.
20405,,1,"Today, I'm calling for him to be fired."
20406,,1,"Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her."
20407,,1,"Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server."
20408,,1,Right?
20409,,1,"She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have."
20410,,1,That you're not allowed to have.
20411,,1,And pretended not to know.
20412,,1,"Remember this one  that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information was classified."
20413,,1,She thought it was the lettering of a paragraph.
20414,,1,There's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on.
20415,,1,"And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened."
20416,,1,"And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on."
20417,,1,Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.
20418,,1,"And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times."
20419,,1,Bad memory.
20420,,1,She's got a terrible memory.
20421,,1,"This elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails."
20422,,1,"The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week."
20423,,1,"Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails?"
20424,,1,"And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI."
20425,,1,"This truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate."
20426,,1,And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.
20427,,1,Going to do it.
20428,,1,Another series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists.
20429,,1,And then you wonder why we do so badly.
20430,,1,"But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you?"
20431,,1,You don't see it at all.
20432,,1,"As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign."
20433,,1,The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters.
20434,,1,They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories.
20435,,1,Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack.
20436,,1,They attack my business.
20437,,1,"I built a great business but, although most people do admit that."
20438,,1,They attacked my wonderful family.
20439,,1,They attacked my temperament.
20440,,1,"But I built an incredible company, those papers are filed."
20441,,1,And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family.
20442,,1,You all saw Melania last night on television.
20443,,1,Did a great job.
20444,,1,That she even has to do that is a shame.
20445,,1,And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength.
20446,,1,We have a winning temperament.
20447,,1,Our country doesn't win anymore.
20448,,1,We don't win anymore.
20449,,1,This is an election about truth.
20450,,1,And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.
20451,,1,Some people can't handle the truth.
20452,,1,"No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are."
20453,,1,We're going to tell them the truth.
20454,,1,"Now even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore."
20455,,1,I don't believe them.
20456,,1,I don't believe them.
20457,,1,"And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show."
20458,,1,"Believe me, folks, we're doing great."
20459,,1,"If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me."
20460,,1,They are so worried.
20461,,1,That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on.
20462,,1,"This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed."
20463,,1,But every rally is the same way.
20464,,1,"At her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event."
20465,,1,Which isn't often.
20466,,1,She's doing debate prep.
20467,,1,She did so much debate prep.
20468,,1,Did we beat her badly in that second debate?
20469,,1,Sort of funny.
20470,,1,She's been doing this for 30 years.
20471,,1,Now she has to do debate prep for five days.
20472,,1,You know what the debate prep is?
20473,,1,It's resting.
20474,,1,"It's lying down, going to sleep."
20475,,1,I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote.
20476,,1,And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.
20477,,1,"They said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls."
20478,,1,"They said, ""Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen."
20479,,1,"It's going to happen."""
20480,,1,"Change stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment."
20481,,1,"They're saying, this is going to happen."
20482,,1,And it is true.
20483,,1,Made up stories.
20484,,1,They're liars and made up stories.
20485,,1,"Without the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing."
20486,,1,She would be nothing.
20487,,1,She really she would be doing so badly.
20488,,1,Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before.
20489,,1,It's my badge of honor.
20490,,1,"I mean, you know, what am I going to do?"
20491,,1,"Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way here's the good news about the New York Times."
20492,,1,They won't be in business much longer.
20493,,1,Do you see what they're losing?
20494,,1,They are dying.
20495,,1,They are dying.
20496,,1,And they're dying also because they're very dishonest.
20497,,1,But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is.
20498,,1,"He said, let's face it this is in the New York Times ""balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy."""
20499,,1,Can you believe that?
20500,,1,They're admitting it.
20501,,1,They don't even care.
20502,,1,It actually said that we don't care.
20503,,1,They will do anything to stop what we're doing.
20504,,1,"Not me, it's what we're doing."
20505,,1,It's an agenda.
20506,,1,It's going to agenda of change.
20507,,1,But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.
20508,,1,"History is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment."
20509,,1,We have to rise.
20510,,1,We have to do it.
20511,,1,We're under tremendous opposition.
20512,,1,We have the greatest people in the world.
20513,,1,That's what I've learned.
20514,,1,"Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned?"
20515,,1,How great the American people are.
20516,,1,I've gone all over the country.
20517,,1,"I have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is."
20518,,1,It's so dishonest.
20519,,1,"I've learned that, too."
20520,,1,They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with.
20521,,1,"Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent."
20522,,1,"Some are very good, but for the most part, yes."
20523,,1,We have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories.
20524,,1,They turn out they make them as bad as possible.
20525,,1,"We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them."
20526,,1,It's a disgrace.
20527,,1,What's going on is a disgrace.
20528,,1,"But we've only just begun to fight, believe me."
20529,,1,We have three weeks.
20530,,1,"You know what, we have three weeks."
20531,,1,And I hear we're going great in Colorado.
20532,,1,"My people in back said, ""You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say."""
20533,,1,Get out and vote.
20534,,1,But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt.
20535,,1,And you see that.
20536,,1,And voter fraud is all too common.
20537,,1,And then they criticize us for saying that.
20538,,1,"And we have even Republicans, ""Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say."""
20539,,1,"Well, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on."
20540,,1,"Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis."
20541,,1,Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous.
20542,,1,"And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you."
20543,,1,They call you a racist.
20544,,1,"They call you all and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody."
20545,,1,"Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you.In 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, ""Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?"""
20546,,1,"The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote."
20547,,1,And we're not supposed to talk about it.
20548,,1,"And your Republican leaders said, ""Oh, this everything is peachy-dory,"" right?"
20549,,1,And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare.
20550,,1,"It's a Washington policy, not me."
20551,,1,The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign.
20552,,1,It's rigged.
20553,,1,It's a bad system.
20554,,1,"The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world."
20555,,1,We're a one-way highway out.
20556,,1,"We get the drugs, right?"
20557,,1,We get the drugs.
20558,,1,We get the unemployment.
20559,,1,We get the empty factories.
20560,,1,Mexico and other countries get the cash.
20561,,1,They get the employment.
20562,,1,They get the plants.
20563,,1,"And for completely open borders she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move."
20564,,1,"If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and and just remember this run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence."
20565,,1,"And by the way, this is our final shot, folks."
20566,,1,"In four years, it's over."
20567,,1,You're never going to be able to win.
20568,,1,You're never going to be able to win.
20569,,1,It's tilting.
20570,,1,It's going to be a one-party system.
20571,,1,"This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment."
20572,,1,"I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th."
20573,,1,So hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do.
20574,,1,Get out of bed and vote.
20575,,1,"No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling.It is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C."
20576,,1,This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.
20577,,1,"First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?"
20578,,1,"Second, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs."
20579,,1,That's a simple one.
20580,,1,"And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in."
20581,,1,"I'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves  Right?"
20582,,1,I've been talking about that for years.
20583,,1,Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end.
20584,,1,"And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign."
20585,,1,Hillary's spent nothing.
20586,,1,She gets all her money from the special interest donors.
20587,,1,And my interest is you; my interest is you.
20588,,1,"We have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change."
20589,,1,And we have to we have no do we have a choice?
20590,,1,"So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash."
20591,,1,And remember the deportation of 800 people?
20592,,1,"Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people.And they were going to be deported for good reason."
20593,,1,"You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there."
20594,,1,"Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States."
20595,,1,"And when I said, ""undo it,"" they said that wouldn't be constitutional."
20596,,1,"Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led?"
20597,,1,The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived.
20598,,1,"Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now."
20599,,1,No growth.
20600,,1,"My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words  jobs, jobs, jobs."
20601,,1,It will happen.
20602,,1,"At the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps."
20603,,1,It's hard to believe this is our country.
20604,,1,We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world.
20605,,1,And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.
20606,,1,Do you know that?
20607,,1,The worst since the Great Depression.
20608,,1,"Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly."
20609,,1,"And this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't  We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization."
20610,,1,Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.
20611,,1,We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world.
20612,,1,"More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go."
20613,,1,We let our companies go so foolishly.
20614,,1,We don't know what we're doing.
20615,,1,"A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction."
20616,,1,"As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent."
20617,,1,We are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world.
20618,,1,That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving.
20619,,1,"We're also going to fix our inner cities 45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working."
20620,,1,"Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago."
20621,,1,Can you believe this?
20622,,1,Since January 1st.
20623,,1,The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years.
20624,,1,Can you believe that?
20625,,1,"Murder, highest rate in 45 years."
20626,,1,So you don't they don't seem to.
20627,,1,"She said, ""nobody cares."""
20628,,1,"And you're right, they don't seem too."
20629,,1,"So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say  What do you have to lose?"
20630,,1,Elect Donald Trump.
20631,,1,I will fix it.
20632,,1,We will fix it.
20633,,1,We will fix it.
20634,,1,We're going to get a very big African-American vote.
20635,,1,We're going to get a very big Latino vote.
20636,,1,"Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote."
20637,,1,"And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, ""See you in four years."""
20638,,1,They don't do anything.
20639,,1,"It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics."
20640,,1,It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.
20641,,1,They want your vote.
20642,,1,Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate.
20643,,1,It is a total disaster.
20644,,1,We will be a rich nation once again.
20645,,1,"But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country."
20646,,1,Our national security begins at the border.
20647,,1,"Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank  I promise, we will build the wall."
20648,,1,Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade.
20649,,1,There go your jobs; and open borders there goes your country.
20650,,1,Simple as that.There are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English.
20651,,1,It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.
20652,,1,"But in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, ""Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American."""
20653,,1,"In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country."
20654,,1,"Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American."
20655,,1,"So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people."
20656,,1,She said they were basement dwellers.
20657,,1,"Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores."
20658,,1,We will be the great Trojan horse folks.
20659,,1,As sure as you're standing there.
20660,,1,"Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS."
20661,,1,He entered as a refugee in November of 2009.
20662,,1,And then we approved for a green card in 2011.
20663,,1,It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.
20664,,1,So let me state this as clearly as I can.
20665,,1,"If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country."
20666,,1,We have enough problems.
20667,,1,We have enough problems.
20668,,1,We've got big problems  $20 trillion in debt.
20669,,1,We have problems like you wouldn't believe.
20670,,1,We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.
20671,,1,A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders.
20672,,1,And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall.
20673,,1,We just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office.
20674,,1,First time they've ever done it.
20675,,1,ICE was just last week.
20676,,1,"As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back."
20677,,1,They were too evil.
20678,,1,"They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs."
20679,,1,I mean these people were evil.
20680,,1,They wouldn't take them back.
20681,,1,"So we come over, we bring, they won't take them back."
20682,,1,"Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets."
20683,,1,And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.
20684,,1,"The ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, ""The most radical immigration proposal in U.S."
20685,,1,"history."""
20686,,1,Here's a summary of the Hillary plan.
20687,,1,She wants to support sanctuary cities.
20688,,1,"She wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens."
20689,,1,They get taken care of better than our great vets.
20690,,1,That won't happen.
20691,,1,She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants.
20692,,1,"Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks."
20693,,1,You see what's going on.
20694,,1,Regardless.
20695,,1,No deportation of Visa overstays.
20696,,1,Expanding catch-and-release on the border.
20697,,1,She wants it expanded.
20698,,1,"In other words, catch them and say, ""Oh, you can go."""
20699,,1,"Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers."
20700,,1,Freeing even there go your jobs freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.
20701,,1,"And this is to me, the beauty of them all."
20702,,1,"Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East."
20703,,1,She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country.
20704,,1,"Either we win this election, or we lose our country."
20705,,1,"Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first."
20706,,1,Here are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017.
20707,,1,We're so close.
20708,,1,We have to get it over the line.
20709,,1,We're so close.
20710,,1,Forget the press.
20711,,1,"Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media."
20712,,1,"Most of them good news fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion."
20713,,1,They're going down.
20714,,1,"Financially, big trouble."
20715,,1,A lot of big trouble.
20716,,1,They've got a lot of big trouble.
20717,,1,That's good.
20718,,1,We're going to have and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet.
20719,,1,"You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it."
20720,,1,We should have a choice.
20721,,1,We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger.
20722,,1,We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation.
20723,,1,"We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America."
20724,,1,And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally.
20725,,1,We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement.
20726,,1,Law and order and justice.
20727,,1,Law and order and justice.
20728,,1,We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress.
20729,,1,We're going to save your Second Amendment.
20730,,1,And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
20731,,1,"You have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true."
20732,,1,Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.
20733,,1,There's a lot of love in this room.
20734,,1,A lot of love.
20735,,1,And we don't want a divided country.
20736,,1,We want to bring other people.
20737,,1,We want to love everybody in our country.
20738,,1,It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment.
20739,,1,"On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter."
20740,,1,"That's you, and you."
20741,,1,"I am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation."
20742,,1,I am going to fight for every child living in poverty.
20743,,1,"I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds."
20744,,1,I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust.
20745,,1,And those jobs and factories are not with us any more.
20746,,1,"They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us."
20747,,1,"I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests."
20748,,1,"And with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign."
20749,,1,That's pretty remarkable.
20750,,1,I'm doing it.
20751,,1,I'm going to fight to bring us all together.
20752,,1,We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans.
20753,,1,"Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag."
20754,,1,Thank you.
20755,,1,"In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life."
20756,,1,You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country.
20757,,1,This is a movement that they have never seen before.
20758,,1,They've never seen anything like this before.
20759,,1,There has never been like this before.
20760,,1,"You're going to look back at this election and say, ""This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time."""
20761,,1,"Once again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people."
20762,,1,"You will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again."
20763,,1,We will make America wealthy again.
20764,,1,We will make America strong again.
20765,,1,We will make America safe again.
20766,,1,"And we will make America great again.Thank you, everybody."
20767,,1,God bless you.
20768,,1,"November 8th, go out and vote."
20769,,1,November 8th.
20770,,1,"God bless you, everybody."
20771,,1,Thank you.
20772,,1,"In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today."
20773,,1,"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election if I win!ALTERNATE Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today."
20774,,1,"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept without delay or hesitation the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.Now, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.The question of voter fraud came up during the debate."
20775,,1,"We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.John Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence."
20776,,1,"This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.A campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.And a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.In addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile who is now under tremendous pressure to resign."
20777,,1,"But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined."
20778,,1,"This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.So it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night."
20779,,1,This is an unprecedented question.
20780,,1,"If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.So what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws."
20781,,1,"These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result."
20782,,1,"I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.But, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration."
20783,,1,Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
20784,,1,Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
20785,,1,"Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.Right now, our economy isn't growing at all."
20786,,1,"I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less."
20787,,1,"Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico."
20788,,1,Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.
20789,,1,"When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in."
20790,,1,"That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.Right now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.It's about time.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words  jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office."
20791,,1,It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce.
20792,,1,"The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.It's going to be America First.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering."
20793,,1,The violence is unbearable.
20794,,1,You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.
20795,,1,"There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say  what do you have to lose?"
20796,,1,Vote for Donald Trump.
20797,,1,"I will fix it.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders."
20798,,1,"Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.So let me state this as clearly as I can.
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.
And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today.
Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities.
My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.If I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.We are going to save American lives.Either we win this election, or we lose the country.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.
It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.
I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.
You're going to remember this day.
This is a movement like you've never seen before.
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Because if we win –We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.
In 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration.We will be a strong nation again.
American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia.Strength will also require growth.Right now, our economy isn't growing at all.
We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter.
I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less.
Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.
That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
That's how our system is corrupt and broken.We're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.Hillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.Those reforms include the following A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words  Jobs, Jobs, JobsAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.We are going to start making things in America again and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office.
It will report to what we call the American Desk.
The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.It's going to be America First.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.The violence is unbearable.
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.
And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say  what do you have to lose?Vote for Donald Trump.
I will fix it.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders."
20799,,1,"Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can.If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.
And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl.
In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home.
He left her on the side of a dirt road.A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported but never was.What kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?Either we win this election, or we lose the country.A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.You're going to remember this day.This is a movement like you've never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the mostimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Because if we win –We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.
In 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.But you have to vote on November 8th.Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns raised from special interests and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.
Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I.
My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need.
This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort.
The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example.
I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.We will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.We're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble.
We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own.
The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure.
This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System.
My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed structurally deficient."
20800,,1,"We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says  Trenton Makes, The World Takes."
20801,,1,"Under a Trump Administration, I can promise you  we are going to start making things in America again and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.She's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance more pay-for-play.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.We're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.
The violence is unbearable.
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.
There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.
And it's getting worse.To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say  what do you have to lose?Vote for Donald Trump.
I will fix it.We will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade and open borders."
20802,,1,"Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.She even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.So let me state this as clearly as I can.
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.

He left her on the side of a dirt road.A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported but never was.If I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported.
And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.Either we win this election, or we lose the country.A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.For the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.
You're going to remember this day.This is a movement like you've never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.If we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you.
[ ] Thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you please sit down.
Thank you.It's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom.
Amazing place.
President Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before.
It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now.
We are a very divided nation.I'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me.
But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer.
Our country has been so good to me.
I love our country and I felt I had to act.
I've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years.
I've been a major part of it.
I know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans.
The rules are rigged.
Nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working.
One in five households have no one with a job.
45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.We have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.We've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now.
They don't know how to win the wars at home.
We have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.
Change has to come from outside our very broken system.
Our system is broken.The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime.
The system is totally rigged and broken.
First, the issue of voter fraud.
According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate.
And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable.
1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting.
I wonder how that happens.
2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks.
These are numbers.
Fourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote.
The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States.
But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.She recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall.
Well, that's a lies.
Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example.
It was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI.
He said he did that for national security reasons.
Highly respected man.
A four-star general.
This took place two days ago.
How must he feel.
A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.Why is she allowed to run?
The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption.
They're corrupt.
They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible.At my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.
On the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there.
Very small crowds.
You know it.
They know it.
Over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles.
But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out.
They refused to talk about it.
They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting.
AT&T; is buying Time Warner and the CNN.
A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.Likewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes.
It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country.Very very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars.
They should be paying those taxes.Additionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do.
Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.
This should never ever have been approved in the first place.
They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter.
Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.
Total Fabrication.
The events never happened, never.
All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.Here is why this is relevant to you.
If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you.
Your jobs.
Your security.
Your education.
Your healthcare.
The violation of religious liberty.
The theft of your second amendment.
The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more.Look at what they've done to you with your jobs.
It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt.
You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.Now, we didn't know this.
We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape.
We didn't know this.
We were amazed at the level of violence.
These were paid operatives.
Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.
This is a criminal act.
Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted.
But because of the rigged system they probably won't be.
Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories.
But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.The rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense.I have no special interest but you the American Vogel.
I didn't have to do this, believe me.
There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it.
I love our country.
I love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it.
Thank you.
One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters.
We now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country.
I think it does.I know it does.
My economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade.
Now, our jobs have been taken away.
They've gone to Mexico.
They've gone to so many other countries.
It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change.
Believe me it's going to change.
And that goes for all countries.
When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.They're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason.
And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade.
We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real.My security plan, so important.They've taken the jobs from us.
My security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.My ethics plan will end corruption in our government.
We will.
Corruption is massive.We will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people.
That is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract.
I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character.
I am asking the American people to dream big once again.What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again.
It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC.Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC  FIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.
SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health.
THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.
Regulations are killing our country and our jobs.
FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune.
FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.
SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening.
On the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers.
Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that.
We're going to change that very very fast.FIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205.
SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country.
THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.
China is a currency manipulator.
What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them.
They have been very smart.
I blame our politicians for letting this take place.
So easy to stop so easy to stand.FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.
FIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves,   including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.SIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward.
We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen.
Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward.
Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.SEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs   and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure.
We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars.
We're going to fix our own environment.
.Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law.
We have to do that.FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign.
His wife is a phenomenal woman.
Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice?
I just found that out this morning.
From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
THIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities.
FOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back   and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him.
She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him.
There won't be one such instance if I become president.
FIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.
And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country.
We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%.
Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner.
We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant.
We can't allow that to happen   we have enough problems.
All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.
We will be very careful.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration  1.
Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act.
An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy.
We need that so badly.
We need jobs.
Our jobs have left us.
Our good jobs have really left us.The largest tax reductions are for the middle class.
Who have been forgotten.
Called the forgotten man and woman.
They have been forgotten.
A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut.
And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy.
The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified.
The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.
It's stuck.
We can't bring it back.
Two and a half to five trillion dollars.
Companies can't get it back into the country.
Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money.
We are going to simplify that.
We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country.
2.
The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.
They leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others.
They leave the United States and fire all of their employees.
They go to Mexico or another country.
They build a beautiful brand new plant.
They hire other people.
They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making.
They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me   but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?We have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits.
So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences.
We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences.
And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.3.
American Energy & Infrastructure Act.
Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years.
Our infrastructure is in such trouble.
We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama.
In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added.
Think of it and we haven't fixed anything.
We haven't fixed anything.
What have we doe?
Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt.
All-time high.
That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape.
VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that.
We are going to work on fixing that   because our veterans are not treated properly.
We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans   and we're not going to have that.
It is revenue neutral.
4.
School Choice and Education Opportunity Act.
Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.
And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities.
We do so badly on education.
If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top.
You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close.
We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close.
We're at the bottom of the list.
Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working.
We will change it and we will make it good.
It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.
Have you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall   we're going to need them   we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car?
They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again.
Those are people those are great people.5.
Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.
Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that.
The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way.
The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.
We have to do it because that's competition.
The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up.
Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years.
And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good.
Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA  there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.
Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug.
They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do.
They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved.
We are going to speed up that process very significantly6.
Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act.
Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.
so good7.
End Illegal Immigration Act.
Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it.
Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall.
With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.
Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 Ѕ months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person.
But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway.
We have our people.
We have out take care of our people.
Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal.
But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out.
They come back, they go to prison for quite a while.
They come back, they come back again they go five years.
Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed.
Five times.
But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times.
When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms.
They will stay out.
Once you do that, they will stay out.
Right now, they have no consequence.
They have no consequence.
Also reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.
8.
Restoring Community Safety Act.
Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me.
We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars   or out of our country and into the country where they came from.
9.
Restoring National Security Act.
Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment.Now, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now.
We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength.
We need a strong military.
Our military is so terribly depleted.
It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice.
If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support.
But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day.
But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line.
We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business.
And we will pay the bill.
So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable.
Also, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values   we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens.
We want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't.
Just come on in folks.
Just come on in.10.
Clean up Corruption in Washington Act.
Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.
This is my pledge to you.
And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.
And importantly we will Make America Great Again.Believe me.
Thank you.
It's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.In 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.Early voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.Yesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption.
I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption.
Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics.
Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.So I have a message today to the voters of America.
It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents.
It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America because we are all just One America.It's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.And my message is this  if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas.
Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism.
She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.Next, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more including Iraq.
Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.In the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding many billions,"" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father."
20803,,1,"Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.The humiliation for our country never seems to end and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State."
20804,,1,"She's not a diplomat she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.The Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.When I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression."
20805,,1,"The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.If you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military."
20806,,1,"It's part of my 100-day plan.This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.My proposal is based on three crucial words  Peace Through Strength.This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast."
20807,,1,"New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.With a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare."
20808,,1,"Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is ""the craziest thing in the world,"" where ""people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."
20809,,1,"Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class.
My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history.
It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent.
My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades.
Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign  fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries.
When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world.
1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.We will start making things in America.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.Immigration security is national security.Hillary's pledge for open borders"" includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America including a plan to review social media postings."
20810,,1,"We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas ""approved"" on the way in.So let me state this as clearly as I can."
20811,,1,If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.
20812,,1,"And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.All across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.Kate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier."
20813,,1,"Her killer had been deported 5 times before.90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.Laura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home."
20814,,1,"His body was viciously burned.The examples go on and on and on.Under a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.That includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.With a victory in November, everything will change.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017 the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 16 days to make this all happen but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.It will be a government of, by and for the people.For those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply  I Am Your Voice.I'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag."
20815,,1,You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.
20816,,1,"This is a movement like the world has never seen before.You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time."
20817,,1,We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
20818,,1,It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me.
20819,,1,"That is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America."
20820,,1,"That deal is grounded in three promises  safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign  America First.Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President."
20821,,1,"Here is the promise I make to you  whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion."
20822,,1,"I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists I work for you, and only you.Our campaign is about change, optimism, and the future."
20823,,1,"I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday."
20824,,1,"Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything she's just made it worse.American politics is caught in a time loop we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking."
20825,,1,"And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.I have a message for all the doubters in Washington  America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation."
20826,,1,"They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more."
20827,,1,"They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats."
20828,,1,"Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina."
20829,,1,"This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation."
20830,,1,"Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities."
20831,,1,"Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration."
20832,,1,Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans.
20833,,1,No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers.
20834,,1,"Hillary's pledge to enact ""open borders,"" made in secret to a foreign bank would destroy the African-American middle class.At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade."
20835,,1,"Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs."
20836,,1,"Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina."
20837,,1,"It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.If I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call."
20838,,1,"I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States."
20839,,1,We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore.
20840,,1,"When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores."
20841,,1,"It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods."
20842,,1,"I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities."
20843,,1,"Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need."
20844,,1,"The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie."
20845,,1,"It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.Then there is the issue of public safety."
20846,,1,"Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice."
20847,,1,There will be only one set of rules not a two-tiered system of justice.
20848,,1,"The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI put our national security at grave risk and not even face so much as a fine.Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street."
20849,,1,The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.We will also police our streets.
20850,,1,I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace.
20851,,1,Safety is a civil right.
20852,,1,The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police.
20853,,1,"I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods."
20854,,1,The reduction of crime is not merely a goal but a necessity.
20855,,1,We will get it done.
20856,,1,"The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk."
20857,,1,"We must work with our police, not against them.On immigration, my policy is simple."
20858,,1,"I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration."
20859,,1,"I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars."
20860,,1,"A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities."
20861,,1,It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.Infrastructure will be another major goal.
20862,,1,"My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations."
20863,,1,"These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.School choice is at the center of my plan."
20864,,1,"My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice."
20865,,1,"School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states."
20866,,1,I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job.
20867,,1,"My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.This is just the beginning."
20868,,1,"Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted."
20869,,1,It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow.
20870,,1,"The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation."
20871,,1,"Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering imagine if that money had been spent at home.My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world."
20872,,1,"She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed."
20873,,1,"She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed."
20874,,1,"She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed."
20875,,1,"She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed."
20876,,1,She tried a Russian Reset that failed.
20877,,1,She tried an Asia Pivot that failed.
20878,,1,"Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter."
20879,,1,Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona.
20880,,1,"Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing."
20881,,1,Every prediction they made about this law was a lie.
20882,,1,"If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.Now is the time to embrace a New Direction.I've been very lucky and have led a great life."
20883,,1,Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me.
20884,,1,"I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction."
20885,,1,"It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country."
20886,,1,"I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you."
20887,,1,"I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children."
20888,,1,"They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so."
20889,,1,"Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully."
20890,,1,"The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization."
20891,,1,I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians.
20892,,1,I'm tired of being told what can't be done.
20893,,1,"I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.Enough waiting."
20894,,1,The time is now.
20895,,1,There is nothing we can't accomplish.
20896,,1,There is no task or project too great.
20897,,1,"There is no dream outside our reach.Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free."
20898,,1,But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again.
20899,,1,"We have to choose the more optimistic path we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country."
20900,,1,"If we do that, anything is possible.I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future."
20901,,1,"Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln."
20902,,1,"And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans."
20903,,1,"Wow, tremendous."
20904,,1,Wow.
20905,,1,Thank you very much.
20906,,1,Thank you.
20907,,1,Unbelievable.
20908,,1,"People don't know, I worked in Ohio, did you know that?"
20909,,1,[ ] And I had a great experience.
20910,,1,"And if I didn't have a great experience starting out when I was very young, maybe I wouldn't be here right now, who knows?"
20911,,1,"You need that, it was great for confidence also."
20912,,1,"In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio  And we are going to win back the White House."
20913,,1,"A brand new poll from Remington Research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up."
20914,,1,"Early voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don't wanna we don't wanna give this away.AUDIENCE  No!You know, we have a movement going on like they've never seen before in this country."
20915,,1,"Drain the swamps, you've gotta a ""drain the swamp"" sign back there, we're going to drain the swamp, believe me."
20916,,1,"But this is a movement like they've never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we're going to turn our country around, we're going to turn it around fast."
20917,,1,Seventy-five percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction.
20918,,1,We know it's headed in the wrong direction.
20919,,1,"We're going to fix it, we're going to take our country back, and it's going to be put very quickly on the right track."
20920,,1,Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare.
20921,,1,"It's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare, you see that."
20922,,1,"Including premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116 percent."
20923,,1,"Don't worry, you'll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you're not going to have to worry about it."
20924,,1,"Even Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, ""The craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half."""
20925,,1,Job killing  Job killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged.
20926,,1,"Remember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare?"
20927,,1,"He said they could pass Obamacare when he didn't know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place."
20928,,1,"The only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people."
20929,,1,"And it was very, very sad."
20930,,1,"And in all fairness to the Democrats, had our President not lied 28 times remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much they would not have gone for it."
20931,,1,"But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him."
20932,,1,"They've caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks."
20933,,1,"Hillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down  Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse."
20934,,1,"So, here, I'm going to repeal it, replace it."
20935,,1,We're going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better.
20936,,1,"You don't even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it's just Look, it is so it is so out of control, you'll never get to use it."
20937,,1,"Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county."
20938,,1,It's a total disaster.
20939,,1,"Here in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare."
20940,,1,"Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks."
20941,,1,That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon.
20942,,1,"Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it's a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children."
20943,,1,Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth.
20944,,1,Have to win.
20945,,1,"Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C.  Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls, I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer."
20946,,1,Right?
20947,,1,"Wrong, wrong."
20948,,1,Let's get rid of these And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times.
20949,,1,"The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about."
20950,,1,Just found that out yesterday.
20951,,1,WikiLeaks.
20952,,1,"The more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lies between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances, they all get blurred."
20953,,1,"Just today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand, bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts."
20954,,1,Mr.
20955,,1,Band called the arrangement unorthodox.
20956,,1,The rest of us call it outright corrupt.
20957,,1,"In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS."
20958,,1,"If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office."
20959,,1,And we've had enough.
20960,,1,"Honestly, I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness."
20961,,1,Right?
20962,,1,Don't you agree?
20963,,1,Had enough.
20964,,1,"I mean at what point, at what point do we say it?"
20965,,1,Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency.
20966,,1,I propose a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people.
20967,,1,I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say.
20968,,1,"If we win on November eighth, when  OK, OK."
20969,,1,When we win on November eighth.
20970,,1,"We don't want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say."
20971,,1,"The media now, they're going wild."
20972,,1,The media's going wild.
20973,,1,"Because they're saying, you know, this guy's winning in Florida, he's winning in North Carolina, he's winning in Iowa, he's winning in Ohio."
20974,,1,All right.
20975,,1,"When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp."
20976,,1,A lot of spirit in this room it's a good one.
20977,,1,That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.
20978,,1,At the core of my contract is my economic plan.
20979,,1,"That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room jobs, jobs, jobs."
20980,,1,"No, it's terrible what's happened, what's happened in this area, what's happened in this country with jobs is terrible."
20981,,1,"Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate."
20982,,1,Instead the jobs left.
20983,,1,"They didn't come in, they left."
20984,,1,She been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything.
20985,,1,"She's just made things worse, except for herself and her husband."
20986,,1,"Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million Americans live in poverty."
20987,,1,"Nearly one in four Americans, in their prime earning years, are not working or able to work."
20988,,1,"Seventy million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of six are living in abject povertyOur national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling, bad shape."
20989,,1,"Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals."
20990,,1,Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year.
20991,,1,We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
20992,,1,Think of it.
20993,,1,And that's so true.
20994,,1,The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
20995,,1,"What our politicians have allowed to happen to this area, but to all areas of our country."
20996,,1,"NAFTA, TPP they want to approve."
20997,,1,A disaster.
20998,,1,"Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton."
20999,,1,"Remember, every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons."
21000,,1,It was NAFTA.
21001,,1,It was caused by the Clintons.
21002,,1,Why a deal like that was allowed.
21003,,1,"We've lost 70,000 factories."
21004,,1,"Think of that one, 70."
21005,,1,"I tell everybody, it's a typo."
21006,,1,"Can't be 70,000."
21007,,1,It is.
21008,,1,"We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster."
21009,,1,"Just this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers, and moved their jobs to Mexico."
21010,,1,And you've had many.
21011,,1,I could I could name them all day long.
21012,,1,"Under my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products."
21013,,1,"And folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you're not losing your companies anymore."
21014,,1,"And if you do, at least the country's gonna make a lot of money."
21015,,1,OK?
21016,,1,"We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want - right now it's a one-way highway."
21017,,1,"We lose our jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything."
21018,,1,We lose our cash.
21019,,1,"They get the cash, they get the jobs, they get the companies."
21020,,1,"We get the drugs, we get the unemployment."
21021,,1,That's what we get.
21022,,1,We get nothing.
21023,,1,We get less than nothing.
21024,,1,We will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we can't renegotiate it properly.
21025,,1,We're gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies.
21026,,1,Because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people.
21027,,1,We can't.
21028,,1,We can't.
21029,,1,As part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent.
21030,,1,We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans.
21031,,1,We will be a rich nation once again.
21032,,1,"But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country."
21033,,1,"Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, you know that story."
21034,,1,"And spreading violently, it's spreading now into the United States."
21035,,1,"There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States."
21036,,1,"ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East, or what they call the Nation of the Cross."
21037,,1,OK.
21038,,1,The Nation of the Cross.
21039,,1,"They are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims."
21040,,1,This is something that we would read about in history books.
21041,,1,"And not since medieval times, right?"
21042,,1,Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening.
21043,,1,So we have no choice.
21044,,1,We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast.
21045,,1,"And unlike what they've done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we're not giving three and four months notice."
21046,,1,We're coming in.
21047,,1,We're coming in.
21048,,1,"You think General George Patton would say, ""We're coming in in three or four months, get ready""?"
21049,,1,What a bunch.
21050,,1,"They're throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks."
21051,,1,They're hanging their victims from meat hooks.
21052,,1,The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.
21053,,1,"Now Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking."
21054,,1,We don't want ISIS in our country.
21055,,1,"The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores."
21056,,1,I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people.
21057,,1,SO important.
21058,,1,Keeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States.
21059,,1,A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions.
21060,,1,And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program.
21061,,1,That was easy.
21062,,1,We're not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people.
21063,,1,No longer.
21064,,1,So let me state this as clearly as I can.
21065,,1,"If I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country."
21066,,1,Hillary also said she wants totally open borders.
21067,,1,No one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States.
21068,,1,Totally open borders.
21069,,1,A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
21070,,1,"And yes, we will build a wall."
21071,,1,Have to.
21072,,1,We have to.Audience  Build that wall.
21073,,1,Build that wall.
21074,,1,Build that wall.And who is going to pay for the wall?
21075,,1,One hundred percent.
21076,,1,"Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United States."
21077,,1,Their leaders are doing a much smarter job.
21078,,1,But you know what?
21079,,1,We'll be happy with Mexico.
21080,,1,"Mexico's gonna be wonderful, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China and with other - we don't even have good relationships now."
21081,,1,They rip us off and we still don't get along.
21082,,1,At least they should be nice to us.
21083,,1,They're not even nice.
21084,,1,They'll be nice.
21085,,1,Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants.
21086,,1,Right here in Ohio.
21087,,1,Sixty-year old Margaret Costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant.
21088,,1,Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park.
21089,,1,"Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, ""Please, please don't let him out."
21090,,1,"Please take him in."""
21091,,1,"Then there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home."
21092,,1,Earl's body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape.
21093,,1,A blunt force injury to his head.
21094,,1,His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal.
21095,,1,"But others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, ""Don't let them out."
21096,,1,"Don't let them into our society."""
21097,,1,"I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members."
21098,,1,"When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end."
21099,,1,We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military.
21100,,1,Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it's ever been.
21101,,1,Did you know that?
21102,,1,Because I know what you have here.
21103,,1,You guys are good with Wright Patterson.
21104,,1,Right?
21105,,1,What a great place.
21106,,1,"But we're very depleted, we have old equipment."
21107,,1,"We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at 'em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base."
21108,,1,We have a lot of veterans here today.
21109,,1,I want to thank them for their service and let them know as president I have your back.
21110,,1,Believe me.
21111,,1,I have your back.
21112,,1,We will.
21113,,1,"She just said, ""Make America great again, Mr."
21114,,1,"Trump."""
21115,,1,We will make America great again.
21116,,1,Don't worry about it.
21117,,1,We will.
21118,,1,And it won't take too long.
21119,,1,We will change our foreign policy.
21120,,1,"Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil."
21121,,1,We're spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair.
21122,,1,"Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power - Russia - which could very well lead to World War III."
21123,,1,And the way she talks about Putin.
21124,,1,"She's always said she has no idea, but she's always saying Wikileak, it's Russia, and Donald Trump I have nothing to do with Russia."
21125,,1,She said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians.
21126,,1,"The answer's no, no."
21127,,1,"But what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia."
21128,,1,"Look, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say and she uses it to keep trying to get votes."
21129,,1,"I said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along?"
21130,,1,Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries?
21131,,1,And we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them?
21132,,1,Wouldn't that be a good thing?
21133,,1,Because they want to get them out also.
21134,,1,"But she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don't think that's smart, you know."
21135,,1,"You can be very tough, but you shouldn't be doing what she's doing."
21136,,1,"As her own team has said in Wikileaks, she has terrible instincts."
21137,,1,"To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership, it really is time."
21138,,1,It really is.
21139,,1,Can you imagine four more years of Obama?
21140,,1,"That's what you got to  It's high taxes, it's high regulations, all these companies they can't even breathe with the regulations, unnecessary."
21141,,1,It's ISIS all over the place.
21142,,1,"You know, she says she'll stop ISIS."
21143,,1,"Let me tell you, there was no ISIS."
21144,,1,There was no ISIS.
21145,,1,"During her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq, ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right?"
21146,,1,"Well they're not the JV anymore, folks."
21147,,1,"They're going to be no trouble, we are going to knock them so hard."
21148,,1,"But look, look, they're not the JV, and they weren't them."
21149,,1,And now they're in 32 different countries.
21150,,1,So she's saying we will get rid of ISIS.
21151,,1,"She wants to go back home and go to sleep, that's what she wants to do."
21152,,1,"Did you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job?"
21153,,1,"We built the building by the way, under budget, and ahead of schedule."
21154,,1,And she said Donald Trump got off the campaign trail.
21155,,1,"I mean I've been doing six, seven, eight things a day every single day."
21156,,1,She's home sleeping half the time.
21157,,1,I say she's definitely a low energy person.
21158,,1,I said where is Hillary?
21159,,1,"I watched after the last debate, and after the second debate."
21160,,1,"She was tired, wow."
21161,,1,"She walked off that stage, she had a lot of people around, they had a lot of people around her, which was smart."
21162,,1,Everything will change in November.
21163,,1,Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days.
21164,,1,We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation.
21165,,1,We're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core.
21166,,1,"We're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our vets."
21167,,1,We will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement.
21168,,1,We are going to save our second amendment which is under siege.
21169,,1,"And we'll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States."
21170,,1,"Americans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade."
21171,,1,It's like our politics are caught in time loop.
21172,,1,"We keep electing the same people over and over again, Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton, the impeachment, the lying, the whole thing."
21173,,1,"We're going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that, and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses."
21174,,1,"These career politicians keep telling us that things can't change, that we can't find new solutions."
21175,,1,That's basically what they tell us.
21176,,1,Well I have a message for them.
21177,,1,"The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics, and not the critics."
21178,,1,The future belongs to the dreamers.
21179,,1,I'm asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future.
21180,,1,"I'm going to fight for every American, of every background, in every stretch of this nation."
21181,,1,"I'm going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty, and crime and fear."
21182,,1,"And I'm going to fight for the inner cities, and for the African- American community, and the way they're forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety."
21183,,1,"I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special  I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans."
21184,,1,"Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people under one God, saluting one American flag."
21185,,1,"That's right, once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people."
21186,,1,You gotta get out and vote.
21187,,1,It's going to be something special.
21188,,1,"And I tell you this, and I tell others this sometimes, this is amazing group of people, the spirit, the energy, the genius, the genius."
21189,,1,"But you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life, but most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you've ever cast."
21190,,1,Because our country doesn't win anymore.
21191,,1,"We don't win with trade, we don't win with our great military, we don't allow them to win, we don't win with ISIS The world is laughing at us."
21192,,1,We don't win at the borders.
21193,,1,We don't win with taking care of our vets.
21194,,1,We don't win with anything.
21195,,1,We don't win anymore.
21196,,1,We will start winning again like you've never seen before.
21197,,1,And I kiddingly say that one of our great two congressmen that are here someplace where are those great guys?
21198,,1,They're here.
21199,,1,"They're going to be coming to see me at the White House, and they're going to say Mr. President, Mr. President sir, Mr. President  The people of Ohio, they can't take it anymore, sir."
21200,,1,"You're winning too much.You knocked out ISIS, there are too many jobs in Ohio, too many companies are pouring in."
21201,,1,We have a little traffic.
21202,,1,Traffic wouldn't be a bad thing  We are going to win like never before.
21203,,1,We are going to make our country wealthy again.
21204,,1,We are going to make America strong again.
21205,,1,We will make America safe again.
21206,,1,And we will make America great again.
21207,,1,Thank you very much.
21208,,1,"Thank you, everybody."
21209,,1,Make sure you go out and vote.
21210,,1,God bless you.
21211,,1,God bless you.
21212,,1,Thank you.
21213,,1,[ ]  Thank you very much.
21214,,1,"We love New Hampshire, I can tell you that."
21215,,1,I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.
21216,,1,The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation Audience  Lock her up!
21217,,1,Lock her up!
21218,,1,Lock her up!And they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.
21219,,1,Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before.
21220,,1,We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.
21221,,1,I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
21222,,1,This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood.
21223,,1,And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.
21224,,1,"So that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others."
21225,,1,Perhaps finally justice will be done.
21226,,1,"With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring."
21227,,1,Should I even make the speech?
21228,,1,"We will talk about borders, right?"
21229,,1,We will talk about trade.
21230,,1,"We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK?"
21231,,1,"I want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General."
21232,,1,Thank you very much.
21233,,1,Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news.
21234,,1,"I said, ""General get up there and keep them busy."
21235,,1,"We want to digest what just happened here."""
21236,,1,Thank you General.
21237,,1,In 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire   the state of my first victory.
21238,,1,And we are going to win back the White House.
21239,,1,Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it.
21240,,1,"We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly."
21241,,1,"Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare   We can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track."
21242,,1,"It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration.It has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona.Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."
21243,,1,"In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable."
21244,,1,"Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare   admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter."
21245,,1,"Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we?"
21246,,1,We're catching all of these people.
21247,,1,We're doing a good job.
21248,,1,"Jonathan Gruber, there's another."
21249,,1,"See, we didn't forget."
21250,,1,I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.
21251,,1,"I said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two."
21252,,1,"I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said."
21253,,1,So we did not forget.
21254,,1,"Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election."
21255,,1,We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.
21256,,1,But the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter.
21257,,1,Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged.
21258,,1,What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought.
21259,,1,Right?
21260,,1,Right?
21261,,1,"The FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks."
21262,,1,I think they're going to right the ship.
21263,,1,"And they're going to save their reputation by doing so.Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever."
21264,,1,She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive.
21265,,1,"I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better."
21266,,1,"Just this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country."
21267,,1,"Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong."
21268,,1,Do they do anything right?
21269,,1,We don't win anymore.
21270,,1,"We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17."
21271,,1,We're going to start winning again.
21272,,1,We're going to start winning again.
21273,,1,"Because it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination."
21274,,1,"Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place."
21275,,1,Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof.
21276,,1,You don't get to use it.
21277,,1,"We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice."
21278,,1,"But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever."
21279,,1,We'll never have another chance.
21280,,1,"And by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you."
21281,,1,Never going to happen again.
21282,,1,Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th.
21283,,1,"But real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened."
21284,,1,Wow.
21285,,1,We have a big day.
21286,,1,"No think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate."
21287,,1,This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion.
21288,,1,"This is bigger than Watergate   Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena."
21289,,1,"That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more?"
21290,,1,But that was so obvious.
21291,,1,"She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails."
21292,,1,"That to me because it was so simple, you know?"
21293,,1,Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia.
21294,,1,Then she talks to me about Russia.
21295,,1,20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.
21296,,1,"But you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government."
21297,,1,"She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer."
21298,,1,"The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI   and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself."
21299,,1,"Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think."
21300,,1,"Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud."
21301,,1,Just yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
21302,,1,"This man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like."
21303,,1,"The same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time."
21304,,1,And these people are seriously corrupt.
21305,,1,Terribly conflict.
21306,,1,Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts.
21307,,1,"Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign."
21308,,1,"And by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1."
21309,,1,"And if you look at Florida, we're winning."
21310,,1,"Ohio, we're winning."
21311,,1,Iowa we're winning.
21312,,1,Doing great in New Hampshire.
21313,,1,I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania.
21314,,1,"We better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please."
21315,,1,"OK, we will."
21316,,1,"In fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big."
21317,,1,I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire.
21318,,1,"Believe me, I don't have the courage."
21319,,1,"I'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will."
21320,,1,"You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody."
21321,,1,I said that's like that's a lot of dinners.
21322,,1,They don't expect that.
21323,,1,"But you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country."
21324,,1,"And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me."
21325,,1,"I went to some, I became friendly with some."
21326,,1,"And I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad."
21327,,1,"And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here?"
21328,,1,It doesn't fit.
21329,,1,"But I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem?"
21330,,1,"And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that."
21331,,1,But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem.
21332,,1,"But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine."
21333,,1,I'd say heroine?
21334,,1,What do you mean?
21335,,1,And I learned so much.
21336,,1,"And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent  And I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in."
21337,,1,Hard to believe.
21338,,1,"It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far."
21339,,1,"Anyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton."
21340,,1,$1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time.
21341,,1,$1 million.
21342,,1,"The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation."
21343,,1,And you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money.
21344,,1,Today I wrote another check for $10 million.
21345,,1,I'm spending money like crazy.
21346,,1,I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign.
21347,,1,But there's something nice about that.
21348,,1,"Unless I lose, in which case I say, ""What was that all about?"""
21349,,1,"But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest."
21350,,1,"Hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too."
21351,,1,I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people.
21352,,1,"I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression."
21353,,1,"If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp."
21354,,1,At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.
21355,,1,You've been suffering with the jobs.
21356,,1,The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby.
21357,,1,New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent.
21358,,1,"If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe."
21359,,1,Last quarter we were at 1 percent.
21360,,1,Our job numbers last week were horrible.
21361,,1,"They were anemic, as the expression goes."
21362,,1,"They like to say anemic, that was the word they used."
21363,,1,Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.
21364,,1,And they say it's hard because we're a large county.
21365,,1,Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent.
21366,,1,China is at 7 percent.
21367,,1,And China's not happy.
21368,,1,"So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place."
21369,,1,"Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty."
21370,,1,Meanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year.
21371,,1,"You say, ""Who negotiates these contracts?"""
21372,,1,We're living through Obama.
21373,,1,It's true.
21374,,1,"You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do."
21375,,1,We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
21376,,1,They're stealing our jobs.
21377,,1,"Greatest in the history of the world.New Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary."
21378,,1,"We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster."
21379,,1,The Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast.
21380,,1,"We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal."
21381,,1,"And I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage."
21382,,1,So it's complicated.
21383,,1,"I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it."
21384,,1,"We're going to get it done, folks, so easily."
21385,,1,"If a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent."
21386,,1,"So when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states."
21387,,1,"And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals."
21388,,1,Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants.
21389,,1,"A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico."
21390,,1,"And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us?"
21391,,1,"He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around."
21392,,1,But there will be consequences.
21393,,1,"And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border   with their product, you know what they're gonna say?"
21394,,1,"They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay."
21395,,1,It's very simple.
21396,,1,But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things.
21397,,1,We will does anybody know what I mean by that?
21398,,1,We will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
21399,,1,"We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation."
21400,,1,Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country.
21401,,1,"There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had."
21402,,1,"Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent   the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country."
21403,,1,"That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people."
21404,,1,A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program.
21405,,1,"And we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt."
21406,,1,"We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share."
21407,,1,"We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what?"
21408,,1,We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know.
21409,,1,Let me state this as clearly as I can.
21410,,1,"If I'm elected president, I am going to keep   When    We love New Hampshire, I love this place."
21411,,1,I love this place.
21412,,1,"By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places."
21413,,1,The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire.
21414,,1,You know what I said?
21415,,1,"I don't think so, I don't think so."
21416,,1,"These polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is?"
21417,,1,These are false.
21418,,1,I don't think so.
21419,,1,"She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd."
21420,,1,I don't think so.
21421,,1,I think we're winning New Hampshire big.OK.
21422,,1,So we'll change it.
21423,,1,When I'm elected president  I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
21424,,1,A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
21425,,1,"Boy, you people have energy, you're great."
21426,,1,"Well, let's face it, it's been a long time, right?"
21427,,1,It's been a long time.
21428,,1,"You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy.You know what's happening?"
21429,,1,"A lot of these placesA lot of the different places, reports are coming out."
21430,,1,"They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media."
21431,,1,"But people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest."
21432,,1,"They are so dishonest, folks."
21433,,1,"But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted."
21434,,1,"These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs."
21435,,1,We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.
21436,,1,"No, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind."
21437,,1,"But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing."
21438,,1,"I mean, how stupid is this?"
21439,,1,How stupid?
21440,,1,"And I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader."
21441,,1,But we have the wrong people represent us.
21442,,1,So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long.
21443,,1,They were never like that.
21444,,1,They've never seen anything like it.
21445,,1,"And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, ""I've never seen we have never seen anything like it."""
21446,,1,People are coming out that haven't voted in years.
21447,,1,"People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years."
21448,,1,"So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you."
21449,,1,"So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years."
21450,,1,Happening in Texas.
21451,,1,They haven't voted in years.
21452,,1,"And people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans."
21453,,1,They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for.
21454,,1,"And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know."
21455,,1,"Now, who knows who knows?"
21456,,1,They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know.
21457,,1,"Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right?"
21458,,1,I don't think so.
21459,,1,History has taught us that we don't think so.
21460,,1,"So, I think we're doing great.And yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall."
21461,,1,Got to stop the drugs.
21462,,1,Got to stop the drugs.
21463,,1,"Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs."
21464,,1,"I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much."
21465,,1,"Believe me, they're they're not spoken about."
21466,,1,And how about where they're shooting?
21467,,1,"During fires, they're shooting at the firemen."
21468,,1,"Now, this is a new phenomenon."
21469,,1,They're shooting at firemen.
21470,,1,They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires.
21471,,1,So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again.
21472,,1,We're going to bring it like this room.
21473,,1,Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration.
21474,,1,This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.
21475,,1,"You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it."
21476,,1,"The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House."
21477,,1,"He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large."
21478,,1,"Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class."
21479,,1,"She was violently, violently killed."
21480,,1,Outstanding young woman.
21481,,1,"I know her parents; they're incredible.Also among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona."
21482,,1,He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody.
21483,,1,"And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent."
21484,,1,And he shot Grant through the head.
21485,,1,"Another victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant."
21486,,1,And this person was deported five previous times.
21487,,1,"And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on."
21488,,1,"He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time."
21489,,1,The case will go on and on.
21490,,1,Shot in the back while standing with her father.
21491,,1,"Great parents, great brother."
21492,,1,"Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home."
21493,,1,The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal.
21494,,1,"People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen."
21495,,1,"In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer."
21496,,1,Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported.
21497,,1,"People asked please, please deport him."
21498,,1,This is what happened.
21499,,1,This is a crime wave that never ends.
21500,,1,I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.
21501,,1,"When I'm president, believe me, it will end."
21502,,1,"Not only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth."
21503,,1,"Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance   And by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted."
21504,,1,"So as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will."
21505,,1,"You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community."
21506,,1,You will be so proud.I just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on.
21507,,1,"A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped."
21508,,1,"We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before."
21509,,1,"Every every crowd, every auditorium."
21510,,1,"The other night, we had a situation."
21511,,1,"We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in?"
21512,,1,"We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in?"
21513,,1,"And they said, we can't."
21514,,1,"I said, but there's no fire, we're outside."
21515,,1,"He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede."
21516,,1,And it's a stampede of love.
21517,,1,It's true.
21518,,1,It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love.
21519,,1,Because there was so many people.
21520,,1,"They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward."
21521,,1,So I fully understood it.
21522,,1,But we have something going on that's so special.
21523,,1,It's so special.
21524,,1,"We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes."
21525,,1,We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country.
21526,,1,We're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people.
21527,,1,We call them the forgotten men and women.
21528,,1,Greatly simplify your returns.
21529,,1,"The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R; Block, they will not like us.They're not gonna like Trump too much.But we'll greatly simplify your taxes."
21530,,1,"And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent."
21531,,1,We're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth.
21532,,1,Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses.
21533,,1,"So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing."
21534,,1,We are going to create the border.
21535,,1,We are going to stop the drugs.
21536,,1,We're gonna have people come into our country.
21537,,1,"We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."
21538,,1,They have to come in through a legal process.
21539,,1,We want a lot of people to come in.
21540,,1,"And they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally."
21541,,1,And we're gonna streamline the process.
21542,,1,People are waiting on line now 10 years.
21543,,1,"We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally."
21544,,1,"And we want merit, too."
21545,,1,"We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job."
21546,,1,We want to have them also come in based on merit.
21547,,1,A word you don't hear anymore.
21548,,1,A word you don't hear any more.
21549,,1,It's too bad.
21550,,1,We're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court  Who you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States.
21551,,1,"We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege."
21552,,1,"We're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local."
21553,,1,Our military is depleted.
21554,,1,We're going to rebuild our military.
21555,,1,We are going to lead through strength.
21556,,1,"And hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this."
21557,,1,We're getting rid of ISIS.
21558,,1,We're getting rid of ISIS.
21559,,1,ISIS is we have no choice.
21560,,1,"By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand."
21561,,1,Not since not since medieval times.
21562,,1,It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.
21563,,1,ISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do.
21564,,1,"Well, she was there."
21565,,1,"It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way."
21566,,1,"And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back."
21567,,1,And it would have been nice the element of surprise.
21568,,1,Do we agree?
21569,,1,Does anybody not agree?
21570,,1,The element of surprise.
21571,,1,We don't use the element of surprise.
21572,,1,"We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack."
21573,,1,And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.
21574,,1,But we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again.
21575,,1,We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of.
21576,,1,I will work so hard for every community.
21577,,1,"I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community."
21578,,1,I'll be working hard for every community.
21579,,1,And we're gonna have this divided nation come together.
21580,,1,"And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again."
21581,,1,But we are going to make America great again.
21582,,1,And I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire.
21583,,1,Get out and vote.
21584,,1,You're very special people.
21585,,1,"You're very, very special people."
21586,,1,"God bless you, get out and vote."
21587,,1,Thank you.
21588,,1,"Thank you, New Hampshire."
21589,,1,Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.
21590,,1,"As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure.She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.To further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.She even pretended not to know that the letter ""C"" meant confidential information that was classified.As the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit.The Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in.The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street.Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.Hillary should have been convicted long ago.That the legal process has been taking this long is incredible.And now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her.97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General.Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona.He said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees.This is what we mean when we call it a rigged system.Now the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right but what should have been done many months ago.Perhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach.The stakes on November 8th could not be higher.A vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system.What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle.Public Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy.Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself.If the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government.It deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation.Corruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system.When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope."
21591,,1,They detach.
21592,,1,"Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority.Hillary believes money and power not truth and justice should rule the day.As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.This is what we often see in Third World countries where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment.Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.We must save the America.That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP."
21593,,1,The silent majority is back.
21594,,1,"In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House."
21595,,1,A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.It's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums.
21596,,1,"Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD."
21597,,1,WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.Every single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare.
21598,,1,"In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year."
21599,,1,Next year there will be only one.
21600,,1,And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year.
21601,,1,"One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is ""the craziest thing in the world,"" where ""people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half."
21602,,1,"In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable."
21603,,1,"Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter."
21604,,1,"Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.
Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure.She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.
But she didn't care as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.To cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.
She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators whoever offers the highest price.Yet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President.
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope they stop dreaming, they stop trying.When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.Hillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob."
21605,,1,"Hillary believes money and power not truth and justice should rule the day.We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting.
The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons?
Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.Look at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.This will be the year the American people say  enough is enough.This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA.
America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.Her policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.A Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.We will become a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
And yes, we will build a wall.We have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.These were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.Hillary has pledged open borders,"" and supports Sanctuary Cities.Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported but the government refused to act."
21606,,1,I've spent time with his incredible mother.28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders.
21607,,1,"Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant."
21608,,1,"Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.His illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.When I become President, this crime wave ends.We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.We will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military."
21609,,1,"We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family."
21610,,1,"They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.To all Americans I say  it is time for new leadership.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing she's just made things worse.She is the candidate of yesterday."
21611,,1,"We are the movement of the future.Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life."
21612,,1,"We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.With your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.Together, We Will Make America JUST Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again."
21613,,1,"In 8 days, we are going to win the Great State of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House."
21614,,1,Let me start today by making a very important promise.
21615,,1,"When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs."
21616,,1,The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end.
21617,,1,We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again.The political class in Washington has betrayed you.
21618,,1,"They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world."
21619,,1,They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled.I will end the theft of American prosperity.
21620,,1,"I will fight for every last Michigan job.Because, when we win, it's going to be America First.So you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th."
21621,,1,You have to vote.
21622,,1,Vote with all of your heart and soul.
21623,,1,"Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you."
21624,,1,"I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people.I'm asking you to believe in America once again.But to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.It's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes.In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said ""the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable."
21625,,1,"Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive in fact, much more expensive.
I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan.Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails.
Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails just one more lie out of so many.This is the biggest scandal since Watergate.
Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself.
Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity.Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities.
Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.Hillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath.
Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI.
Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear.
Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails.
Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again.
We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating.Hillary is not the victim the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it.Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time.
One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support.
He wrote an article entitled I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary."
21626,,1,Schoen writes  I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.
21627,,1,"Schoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a trial of a sitting President.The investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer.She is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford.
We need to be going to work for the American people we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution.Hillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions.The Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th.
And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.My Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.
When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs.Michigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan.
Today, that number is only 160,000.
Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world.
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State.
Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs.So when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember  Hillary Clinton did much of this to you.Hillary got rich selling your jobs the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons.
Hillary gets rich making America poor.Just look at the devastation.
Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan.
Most of those jobs went to Mexico.
We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi.
They got a raw deal, and they deserve better.GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.Lear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea.FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills.
Their jobs went to Mexico.Chrysler laid off over 5,300 workers.
Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries.Ford laid off 2,155 workers.
Those jobs went to other countries.Now, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico.A Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs.If Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone I will call the executives and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border.It used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.
Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.We are going to turn it all around.
We are going to rebuild Flint.
We are going to rebuild Detroit.
And we are going to rebuild Michigan.I'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons.Look at the City of Detroit.
It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools.Yet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees.I've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America.
That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit.It includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children.My plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations a number Hillary wants to increase and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint.My plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace.
And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States.Hillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty.
The time has come for real change I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success.Hillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.We will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal.
We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.
We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class.We will unleash American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.
The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs.We will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes.
We are going to become a rich country again.
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.
Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan.When we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
And yes, we will build a wall.We've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.
They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been it's a national emergency.
They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the the most radical proposal in U.S."
21628,,1,history.
21629,,1,"When I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.Hillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya.
Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied she blamed it all on a video.Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.
Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan.Now, Hillary trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III.The arrogant political class never learns.
They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results.How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server?
It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another.To all Americans I say  it is time for new leadership.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C.
I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade.America is tired of waiting.
The moment is now.All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach.
Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done   the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing she's just made things worse.
She is the candidate of yesterday.
We are the movement of the future.Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life.
We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.We are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice not money and power should rule the day.We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and special interests.We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.With your vote, we are just 8 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[ ] I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Governor Mike Pence.
Thank you.
And I love you, too.
We have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign.
So I really do thank all of you.
I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done.
And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care  I'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson.
Not only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced.
People don't know how well he did during those primaries.
And I just kept looking back.
And I just kept seeing him.
And boy, I'll tell you.
But even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years.
Thank you.I'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me  Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais.
And let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work.
So I want to thank you very much, Senator.
Fantastic job.
And been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent.
So thank you, Senator.
When we win on November 8th   and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.
Have to do it.
I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced.
And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly.
It is a catastrophe.
The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
Which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century.
Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation.
There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it.
No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill.
To this day, nobody understands it.
The Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country.
Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future.
Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it.
That means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids.
In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent.
Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent.
Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000.
In other words, your health care won't even be usable.
You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it.
People all across the country are devastated.
In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history.
This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.
One-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that.
That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school.
The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation.
The people of Philadelphia.
Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof.
Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed.
Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality.
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive.
She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America.
If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.
It's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win.
Thank you.
Thank you.Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better.
We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families.
It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.We've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family.
And while this is really -- thank you.
While this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here.
But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare.
Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs.
We have to do it.
We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a wholeOur jobs are being stolen.
Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.
The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.
A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me.
And we have the greatest negotiators in the world.
We will use our great negotiators.
We'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places.
And stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior.
We are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania.
We're gonna do it.
And it won't even be difficult.
We're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners.
Our miners have been mistreated horribly.
We will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy.
We're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt.
Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries.
Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me.
It will change.
We're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice.
So important.
That means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school.
It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children.
We will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local.
We're gonna bring it local.
People do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you.
And our system is failing, so it's obviously not working.
We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local.Our tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids.
As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed.
Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you.
We will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families.
We will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.
When did we ever need it more?
Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted.
Thank you.
People love this country, don't they?
Isn't it beautiful, right?
Beautiful.
It's a beautiful thing to watch and see.
And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go.
And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response.
It's an incredible response.
Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that.
Smallest since World War I.
And rebuilding it will require a national effort.
That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well.
With a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again.
To recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.Vocational training is a great thing.
We don't do it anymore.
We don't do it anymore.
And I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded.
And we don't do that anymore.
Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important.
And just in closing -- and they loved it.
They loved it.
They didn't want to be doing what I was doing.
They loved it.
They were so good at it and they loved it.
So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league.
We will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country.
I'm not a politician.
My only special interest is you, the American people.
That's why I've done this.
Thank you very much.
The guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people.
I feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes.
So I have to say with these exceptions.
They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense.
I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success.
I'm running   I'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities.
We need safety.
And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people.
Thank you.
And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy.
I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities.
And I've been working with so many African-American groups.
These are such incredible people.
We've been talking about it, working on it.
We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities.
We're going to bring safety.
We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities.
The spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody.
And it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.
You watch.
Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day.
But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about.
Enough waiting.
Time is now.
But to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past.
We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe.
Think of it.
Think of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.And we're far less safe today than we were before we started.
They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.
It's time for new leadership.
I've led a great life and I truly love our country.
So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this.
All I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized.
The people are amazing, the people are amazing.
If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach.
If we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible.
I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country.
That is how we will truly make America great again.
Thank you very much, thank you everybody.
God bless you, thank you.
Thank you, everybody, thank you.
Wow.
These crowds.
[ ] These crowds are terrific.
Thank you very much.
In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida.
And we are going to win back the White House.
That will happen.
But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there.
We don't want to blow it.
That I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody.
And it's very historic what's happening.
I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me.
This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together.
We're almost at the end.
But we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it.
Aren't we?
The end of the beginning.
Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.
And now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people.
It's going to happen.
It's going to happen.
It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been.
There are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often.
And that's my mother and my father, great people.
I had great parents.
Great parents.
I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze.
It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze  So they're helping us out.
And I just want to say thank you to both of them.
Special, special people.
I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love.
It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks  I've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth.
But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it.
We're going to get them out of it.
We're going to get them out of it.
We have endless wars.
Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen.
Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean.
And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now.
You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.
We're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina.
We're doing great in Pennsylvania.
A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good.
So many different places.
We just got a poll with three up in Virginia.
But we are seriously up in Florida.
That's very important  And I will never, ever let you down.
Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster.
A disaster.
It is a disaster.
It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike.
I will not tell you what the number is.
I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy.
You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning.
You'll learn, you're not going to like it.
In the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent.
Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries.
That's good.
I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that.
Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving.
They're all leaving.
In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.
Obamacare is a total catastrophe.
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.
I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important.
Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.
As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton.
Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days.
She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.
What she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable.
But she has no one to blame but herself.
Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.
Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department.
Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI.
Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that.
Unbelievable.
And as you know, they just found listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails.
And I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place.
I think they're I think they're gonna find a treasure trough.
I can't even imagine.
In fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates.
How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?
You know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot.
They have 650,000?
Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat.
Instead of reporting the breach.
That's a big deal.
You know, to me that's a big deal.
Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal.
That's really that's a real cheater, OK?
That's a cheater.
And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired.
But that's a really big deal.
And you notice, they never the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest.
If you notice, they never go after Hillary.
They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it.
But can you imagine if I got can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate.
You know it would be the electric chair.
They'd reinstitute the electric chair.
No.It'd be headlines all over the world.
This isn't headlines.I bring it up; it's brought up a little bit.
But this isn't like a big deal.
She got the debate questions and answers.But she got the debate questions prior to a debate.
Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right?
Shouldn't he be angry?Now, I'll tell you what.
The system is rigged.
The system is rigged.I've been saying it for a it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out.
But the system is rigged.
Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system.
So corrupt in so many ways.
And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?In four years, not gonna happen.
There's no way.
The numbers won't work.In four years, there's no way.
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.
And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
I mean before you go into phase two let's call what happened on Friday phase two.
Phase one, she's so guilty.
She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.
That's why I say the system is rigged.
She shouldn't be allowed to run.
But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.
Who knows.
650,000 e-mails.
No wonder she can't do anything.No, no.
How do you work?
How do you do it?650,000.
They'll have to explain that to us some day.But they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable.
Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years.
Probably concluding in a criminal trial.
Out today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one.
Just a little while ago.
It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.
You saw that.
The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign.
Can you believe this?
She shouldn't be allowed to run.By the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon.
The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees.
Johnny Damon.Stand up Johnny.
Now, I'll tell ya.
George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine.
Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much.Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine.
He did great.But Johnny Damon was a champ.
He was a winner.
And he loves this area, you know that.
My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends I'll tell you what.
We are going to end we have no choice.
We really have no choice government corruption.
It's going to end.
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8.
We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.
At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.
Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary.
America has lost this is so hard to believe 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida.
They're leaving.
We're going to stop itAnd you have an excellent governor, by the way.
He's fighting hard for you folks.
I don't know I don't know.
All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard.
The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you.
We are it is being stolen from us folks.
It is we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries.
And we're going to stop it.
From now on, it's going to be America first.
America first.
It's going to be America first.
A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors.
It's horrible what's happening to us.
Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.
We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
Killing our jobs.
Our companies are leaving.
Killing our jobs.
We will become a rich nation once again.
But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation.
In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that?
Doubled last year.
Can you believe it?
We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.
I met the police and these are unbelievable people.
We will bring this crime wave to an end.
We will also keep our community safe from terrorism.
Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.
It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history.
Can't let it happen, can't let it happen.
Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country.
Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.
When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program.
And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community.
Got to keep them out.
And we'll build safe zones in Syria.
We have to help the people.
We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.
And believe me, they have plenty of money.
They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled.
They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people.
But we have enough problems in this country.
We don't need Orlando and problems.
We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.
We don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany which is a disaster.
We don't need it.
We have enough problems right now, do we agree?
We have enough problems.
We don't need it.
A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
And yes, we will build a great wall.
We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people.
The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back.We bring them to their countries murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say  get them out, we're not taking them back.
They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say  oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.
I guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration.
Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities.
Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle incredible young woman was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.
A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately.
We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens the ones we just spoke about and we will save American lives.
We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military.
That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base.
Have you ever heard of those places?
Pretty good places.
A lot of people here, lot of people.
I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200 more than that now, much more than that top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.
Great people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible.
Incredible people.
Our new foreign policy will put America first.
Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end.
And it's now in worse shape than ever before.
The Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing.They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe.
They've left our borders wide open at home.
And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.
And it's it's disappearing.
Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing.
Prosperity real prosperity is disappearing.
We owe $20 trillion.
Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade.
We have trade deficits.
Think of that.
Who negotiates these deals?
You know who does?
Stupid people.
Stupid people.
With very stupid leadership.
Who, by the way, they campaign all the time.
He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary.
Why is he campaigning?
She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her.
And that's all he does is campaign.
He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico.
And your military.
I'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems.
But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks.
Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is.
Four more years of no jobs.
Now, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III.
Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her.
Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her.
What are we doing, folks?
She's a mess.
To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership.
Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration.
Thank you.
It's so beautiful over there.
I just noticed the water.
Let's go in for a swim.
It's about 200 degrees out there.Anybody want to go swimming?
Let's go.
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.
And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount.
You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world.
She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.
We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation.
Killing your companies.
Killing them.
One of the reasons they're leaving.
Cancel every illegal Obama executive order.
We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans.
They're not being taken care of.
You know that.
A lot of veterans here.
We're going to take care of our veterans finally.
They have been mistreated for many, many years.
We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement.
We will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege.
We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
We will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach.
There's no dream no dream outside of our reach.
We have all these people telling us what to do.
Politicians they know nothing.
I've dealt with them all my life, folks.
All talk, no action.
I have some friends that are politicians.
So let me just say there's some good ones.
OK?
There are some good.I'll tell you what, you take a look at the media.
These are the most dishonest people anywhere.
These are the most they the media the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live.
They're a big fat cog in the and they never show the crowds.
They never show what's happening.
But you know what?
You hear when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game.
But they never show it.
They never show it.
They never show it.People of Florida, we love you.
All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past.
Hillary is a candidate of yesterday.
We are the movement of the future.
We are.
We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many.
You probably heard over the last couple of weeks Texas is in play""; ""Texas that Georgia is in play."""
21630,,1,"And I'm saying, ""Gee, that's too bad."""
21631,,1,"Let me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that."
21632,,1,And they know it.
21633,,1,"But when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them."
21634,,1,But we are winning almost everywhere.
21635,,1,"I think give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere."
21636,,1,And I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning.
21637,,1,I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that.
21638,,1,"We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests."
21639,,1,We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future.
21640,,1,I am asking you to dream big I got to dream big.
21641,,1,"Because with your vote, we are just can you believe this?"
21642,,1,six days away.
21643,,1,Think of that.
21644,,1,From the change you've been waiting for your entire life.
21645,,1,We're going to work together.
21646,,1,We're going to vote.
21647,,1,You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th.
21648,,1,But you're going to vote.Thank you.
21649,,1,I love that guy.
21650,,1,"He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, ""You're going to win."""
21651,,1,We're going to win.
21652,,1,"Thank you, man."
21653,,1,Thank you.
21654,,1,"We have great, great love.You know, we're in a divided nation."
21655,,1,We are a divided nation.
21656,,1,We're not going to be divided.
21657,,1,We're going to have such love in this country.
21658,,1,We're going to have such love and such respect.
21659,,1,"Together, we will make America wealthy again."
21660,,1,We will make America strong again.
21661,,1,We will make America safe again.
21662,,1,And we will make America great again.
21663,,1,Thank you very much.
21664,,1,"Thank you, folks."
21665,,1,"God bless you, everybody."
21666,,1,God bless you.
21667,,1,Thank you.
21668,,1,Get out and vote.
21669,,1,Get out and vote.
21670,,1,Thank you.
21671,,1,Thank you.
21672,,1,Thank you.
21673,,1,"[ ] I love that sign, ""Blacks for Trump."""
21674,,1,"I love that sign, thank you."
21675,,1,There are a lot of those signs.
21676,,1,Thank you.
21677,,1,Women for Trump.
21678,,1,Hispanics for Trump.
21679,,1,"There's one ""Women and Hispanics for Trump."""
21680,,1,Thank you very much.
21681,,1,"In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent."
21682,,1,"We're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you."
21683,,1,"The system is rigged, remember that."
21684,,1,The system is rigged.
21685,,1,Right now it's rigged.
21686,,1,We're going to change it.There's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now.
21687,,1,"As I mentioned yesterday, on of the and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig  is a close associate of John Podesta."
21688,,1,"The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail."
21689,,1,Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
21690,,1,"Now, today, in a newly released e- mail through WikiLeaks again we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that  right?"
21691,,1,"And that Kadzik said quote ""It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails."""
21692,,1,Remember they were waiting for the e-mails.
21693,,1,"Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief."
21694,,1,"These are the people that want to run our country, folks."
21695,,1,The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.
21696,,1,"But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice."
21697,,1,"So, show up early and vote."
21698,,1,Show up early.
21699,,1,"You know, the lines are incredible."
21700,,1,The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida.
21701,,1,Don't believe it.
21702,,1,Don't believe it.
21703,,1,Get out there and vote.
21704,,1,Pretend we're slightly behind.
21705,,1,You got to get we don't want to blow this.
21706,,1,"This is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again."
21707,,1,It's not going to happen.
21708,,1,"In four years, it's not going to happen it can't happen again."
21709,,1,This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before.
21710,,1,"These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love."
21711,,1,Got to get out and vote.
21712,,1,Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare.
21713,,1,And Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive.
21714,,1,She's doubling down.
21715,,1,"It's just been announced that the residents of Florida sorry to tell you this, folks are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike."
21716,,1,"Now, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people."
21717,,1,"I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial."
21718,,1,And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else.
21719,,1,"As an example, in the great state of Arizona which I just left premiums are going up more than 116 percent."
21720,,1,It's out of control.
21721,,1,Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year.
21722,,1,Lots of luck in your negotiation.
21723,,1,"In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable."
21724,,1,"Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof."
21725,,1,"Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works."
21726,,1,Obamacare never had a chance.
21727,,1,It's a catastrophe.
21728,,1,Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive.
21729,,1,It's going to go up a lot.
21730,,1,"People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay."
21731,,1,I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States.
21732,,1,Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.
21733,,1,"As you know, the FBI has did you hear about this little event?"
21734,,1,The FBI re-opening the investigation.
21735,,1,They're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton.
21736,,1,"Crooked Hillary, she's crooked."
21737,,1,Lock her up!
21738,,1,Lock her up!
21739,,1,"Lock her up!She is a crooked one, there's no question."
21740,,1,"Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today?"
21741,,1,"That's going to be a great term for a president, right?"
21742,,1,"Boy, oh boy, what a mess."
21743,,1,This is the biggest scandal since Watergate.
21744,,1,And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years.
21745,,1,It's about time.
21746,,1,"Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time."
21747,,1,"She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself."
21748,,1,Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.
21749,,1,"The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly."
21750,,1,"Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off."
21751,,1,And I met with the people of Little Haiti.
21752,,1,"Anybody here?These are great people, great, thank you.Hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server."
21753,,1,Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI.
21754,,1,"Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer."
21755,,1,"And she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena."
21756,,1,She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile  and then used those debate questions to cheat.
21757,,1,"It's cheating, the worst level."
21758,,1,Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach.
21759,,1,"So she got the answers, cheating."
21760,,1,"She got the questions, cheating."
21761,,1,"And then she rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening she used them against Bernie Sanders."
21762,,1,Can you imagine.
21763,,1,she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered.
21764,,1,We won those debates.
21765,,1,Did you see her at the end of the debates?
21766,,1,"Folks, she was exhausted."
21767,,1,You know what she did?
21768,,1,She immediately went home and went to sleep.
21769,,1,"Hillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way."
21770,,1,"But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th."
21771,,1,"Now in Florida's case, earlier."
21772,,1,"Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable."
21773,,1,We're doing great with the African-American community.
21774,,1,We're doing great with the Hispanic community.
21775,,1,"And the lines are four, five and six blocks long."
21776,,1,They've never seen anything like it.
21777,,1,And the polls have just come up.
21778,,1,We're way up in Florida.
21779,,1,"I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote."
21780,,1,"OK, ready?"
21781,,1,We're going to pretend we're down.
21782,,1,We're down.
21783,,1,"Pretend, right?"
21784,,1,We'll pretend we're down.
21785,,1,"No, we got to win."
21786,,1,We got to win big.
21787,,1,We got to beat her.
21788,,1,Got to beat her.
21789,,1,"We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina."
21790,,1,I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear.
21791,,1,"Folks, you're going to be so proud."
21792,,1,You're going to be so proud.
21793,,1,We're going to make America great again.
21794,,1,You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.
21795,,1,"If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis."
21796,,1,"Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right?"
21797,,1,Remember when he was impeached for lying?
21798,,1,He can't practice law.
21799,,1,He doesn't have the right to practice law.
21800,,1,Didn't we just go through this?
21801,,1,And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama.
21802,,1,That's the last thing.
21803,,1,And this will be worse.
21804,,1,"That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border."
21805,,1,"Without a border, we don't have a country."
21806,,1,The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected.
21807,,1,She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted.
21808,,1,"Because look, the first time I mean, frankly, forget about this time."
21809,,1,The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything?
21810,,1,There shouldn't have been a second time.
21811,,1,But I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance.
21812,,1,"And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried."
21813,,1,They're duplicates.
21814,,1,How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with?
21815,,1,"So today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump."
21816,,1,"We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.In another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government right, this should be another one."
21817,,1,"Just like swamp you know the swamp little statement this one, this one."
21818,,1,Do you remember what it is?
21819,,1,Right?
21820,,1,"All the money is in, right?"
21821,,1,They said all the money is in.
21822,,1,They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets.
21823,,1,They said all the money is in.
21824,,1,This is what is running for office.
21825,,1,"Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself."
21826,,1,She should be ashamed of herself.My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government.
21827,,1,That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.
21828,,1,Makes sense.
21829,,1,I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now.
21830,,1,"When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp."
21831,,1,Gonna drain the swamp.
21832,,1,"We're gonna drain the swamp, folks."
21833,,1,We're gonna drain that swamp.
21834,,1,Another important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism.
21835,,1,"These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with."
21836,,1,These are the most dishonest people.
21837,,1,There has never been dishonesty there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election.
21838,,1,There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election.
21839,,1,"Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds."
21840,,1,They won't do that.
21841,,1,The very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy think of it of the First Amendment.
21842,,1,"Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president."
21843,,1,It's unbelievable.
21844,,1,"It's un-honest.For instance, we have a great story."
21845,,1,We give it out to the media.
21846,,1,They'll make it look as bad as possible as bad as possible.
21847,,1,ParentheticallySo sad.
21848,,1,"Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year."
21849,,1,They just announced that.
21850,,1,So bad.
21851,,1,I feel so badly for them.
21852,,1,Just announced 97 percent.
21853,,1,"Oh, they're doing great."
21854,,1,"And then they tell you who to vote for, you know?"
21855,,1,Who to vote for.
21856,,1,They want crooked Hillary.
21857,,1,This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country.
21858,,1,And they're talking about it all over the world.
21859,,1,At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs.
21860,,1,"Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty."
21861,,1,Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty.
21862,,1,Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.
21863,,1,"This is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable."
21864,,1,"As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization."
21865,,1,We will replace decades of failure with generations of success.
21866,,1,"Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary."
21867,,1,"And here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct."
21868,,1,"America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization."
21869,,1,Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.
21870,,1,We are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world.
21871,,1,"Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries."
21872,,1,China and others are making our product.
21873,,1,We don't make it anymore.
21874,,1,A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida.
21875,,1,"My second home, you know that, I'm here all the time."
21876,,1,"My second home, great place.The theft of American prosperity will end."
21877,,1,"So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity."
21878,,1,A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place.
21879,,1,Currency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us.
21880,,1,"We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster."
21881,,1,"And Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it."
21882,,1,But she's going to approve it.
21883,,1,"Then she lied during the debate, right?"
21884,,1,She lied.
21885,,1,She lied during the debate.
21886,,1,"She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied."
21887,,1,"And she lied about the line in the sand, right?"
21888,,1,She lied.
21889,,1,"As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent."
21890,,1,We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations  and use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources.
21891,,1,We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars.
21892,,1,We don't even know who's doing what with the money.
21893,,1,We're gonna spend the money here.
21894,,1,We're gonna work on our own environment.
21895,,1,That includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades.
21896,,1,"We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation  A terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa."
21897,,1,"You read, you saw."
21898,,1,"Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars."
21899,,1,We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen.
21900,,1,"I just left Iowa, most beautiful place."
21901,,1,"The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did."
21902,,1,Now two of them are dead.
21903,,1,An attack on our police is an attack on all of us.
21904,,1,"Law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that."
21905,,1,"According to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been."
21906,,1,"And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this."
21907,,1,"And what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership."
21908,,1,"To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you."
21909,,1,We will restore law order and justice in America justice.
21910,,1,Thank you.
21911,,1,"Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa.We will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism."
21912,,1,Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries.
21913,,1,Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities.
21914,,1,"When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community."
21915,,1,"Now, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones."
21916,,1,But we have enough problems in our country.
21917,,1,She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now.
21918,,1,She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.
21919,,1,"And then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right."
21920,,1,"She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth."
21921,,1,"And we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something?"
21922,,1,"Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare."
21923,,1,She's got bigger problems.
21924,,1,"Let's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.Thank you.It's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad?"
21925,,1,They don't do it.
21926,,1,"But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive."
21927,,1,She's never had a crowd like this in her life.
21928,,1,"President Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right?"
21929,,1,"He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing."
21930,,1,"He's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so."
21931,,1,"But we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds."
21932,,1,There's something happening.
21933,,1,They're not reporting it.
21934,,1,"Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie."
21935,,1,"But there's something happening, Katie."
21936,,1,"There's something happening, Katie."
21937,,1,A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
21938,,1,"And yes, we will build the wall."
21939,,1,Thank you.
21940,,1,We've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.
21941,,1,First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.
21942,,1,They tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been.
21943,,1,"Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win."
21944,,1,"So, they're racing across the border."
21945,,1,I don't know.
21946,,1,"I'm sorry to do this to you, folks."
21947,,1,"Hillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore."
21948,,1,And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where Right?
21949,,1,Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant.
21950,,1,The immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives.
21951,,1,And I believe that.
21952,,1,"As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back."
21953,,1,Countless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants.
21954,,1,"Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant."
21955,,1,The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery.
21956,,1,And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated.
21957,,1,They were begging.
21958,,1,"He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder."
21959,,1,"A Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives."
21960,,1,"And I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs ""Cubans for Trump."""
21961,,1,Cubans.
21962,,1,I love Cubans.
21963,,1,"So they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right?"
21964,,1,You know.
21965,,1,They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor.
21966,,1,"And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.What's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right."
21967,,1,"What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair."
21968,,1,Thank you.
21969,,1,Thank you.We're going to take care of it.
21970,,1,"The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job."
21971,,1,We're going to fix the inner cities we're going to fix the inner cities.
21972,,1,"Thank you, fellows, that's so good."
21973,,1,Blacks for Trump.
21974,,1,That's so nice.We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.
21975,,1,That includes total support for homestead air reserve base.
21976,,1,"A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about."
21977,,1,We will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order.
21978,,1,"If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve including protecting religious and political freedom, right?"
21979,,1,"I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients."
21980,,1,You know it's really called peace through strength.
21981,,1,"Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully."
21982,,1,"Have to get rid of ISIS we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS."
21983,,1,But we have to get to rebuild our country.
21984,,1,We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East six trillion dollars.
21985,,1,"And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started."
21986,,1,"Six trillion we lost lives, the most incredible, great people."
21987,,1,Our new foreign policy will put America first.
21988,,1,Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya.
21989,,1,"And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment."
21990,,1,"And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum."
21991,,1,Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.
21992,,1,"Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense."
21993,,1,"She's got no instinct, but that's decided Hillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars."
21994,,1,"I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back rather have all those lives."
21995,,1,Love to have those lives back.
21996,,1,"But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse."
21997,,1,They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe.
21998,,1,They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.
21999,,1,And these are foreign wars that we don't win we don't win.
22000,,1,"We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore."
22001,,1,"We're going to start winning again, you watch."
22002,,1,We're going to start.
22003,,1,To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership.
22004,,1,Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration.
22005,,1,We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.
22006,,1,"And she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that."
22007,,1,"We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans."
22008,,1,Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local.
22009,,1,Support the men and women of law enforcement.
22010,,1,"We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege  and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States."
22011,,1,"Clinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington."
22012,,1,I wonder if she's going to be there much longer.
22013,,1,What do you think?
22014,,1,I don't think so.
22015,,1,I don't know.
22016,,1,I'm not sure she's going to be there.
22017,,1,"But she wants she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C."
22018,,1,"I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country."
22019,,1,I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade.
22020,,1,America is tired of waiting.
22021,,1,The moment is now.
22022,,1,All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.
22023,,1,"There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach."
22024,,1,Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done.
22025,,1,"The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media."
22026,,1,Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing.
22027,,1,She's just made things worse.
22028,,1,Look at her record.
22029,,1,She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the right?
22030,,1,Is that right?
22031,,1,We are the movement of the future.
22032,,1,Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life.
22033,,1,We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters.
22034,,1,"And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now."
22035,,1,"We're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day."
22036,,1,And I understand the other side very well.
22037,,1,"I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done."
22038,,1,"We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer."
22039,,1,"We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests."
22040,,1,We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.
22041,,1,"With your vote, we are just think of it six days away."
22042,,1,This started on June 16th of last year.
22043,,1,It's a long time.
22044,,1,Seems like a long time ago.
22045,,1,But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.
22046,,1,It'll never happen again.
22047,,1,"It'll never, ever happen."
22048,,1,It's not going to happen in four years.
22049,,1,"When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again."
22050,,1,I'm telling you.
22051,,1,This whole thing will never happen again.
22052,,1,There's never been a movement like this in the history of our country there's never been a movement like this.Thank you.
22053,,1,Thank you.There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country it's never happened.
22054,,1,"Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen."
22055,,1,We have to close the deal.
22056,,1,We have to close get out and vote.
22057,,1,"November 8th fine, better if you vote now."
22058,,1,"Maybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote.Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again."
22059,,1,"Thank you very much, everybody."
22060,,1,Thank you.
22061,,1,Thank you.
22062,,1,Get out and vote.
22063,,1,"God bless you, everybody."
22064,,1,Thank you.
22065,,1,This is amazing.
22066,,1,What a great place.
22067,,1,Thank you very much.
22068,,1,We have thousands of people outside trying to get in.
22069,,1,But we should start.
22070,,1,Do we agree?
22071,,1,[ ] We should start.
22072,,1,So they'll come in.
22073,,1,They'll come in.First of all I want to thank you.
22074,,1,"Special, special place."
22075,,1,It's a special place with incredible people.
22076,,1,"In one day, do you believe this?"
22077,,1,One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina   And we are going to win back the White House.
22078,,1,This election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class.
22079,,1,You're seeing what's happening.
22080,,1,Everybody's watching.
22081,,1,Or whether we are ruled by the people.
22082,,1,"We're going to be ruled by the people, folks."
22083,,1,That is going to be the choice.
22084,,1,"A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses."
22085,,1,Nothing but losses.
22086,,1,We don't win anymore as a country.
22087,,1,We're going to start winning again.
22088,,1,They get rich by making America poorer in many cases.
22089,,1,It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry.
22090,,1,And these are among the most dishonest people.
22091,,1,"They don't give you the truth, folks."
22092,,1,They don't give you the truth.
22093,,1,They rarely give you the truth.
22094,,1,You know it.
22095,,1,And they know it.
22096,,1,That's the scary part.
22097,,1,They know it.It's time to fight for America.
22098,,1,"I'm not a politician, I can say proudly."
22099,,1,My only special interest is you.
22100,,1,It's you.
22101,,1,We're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you.
22102,,1,We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country.
22103,,1,We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers.
22104,,1,We're going to put them back to work.
22105,,1,The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.The corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA.
22106,,1,China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization.
22107,,1,One of the disasters.
22108,,1,The job-killing deal with South Korea.
22109,,1,That was a Hillary Clinton beauty.
22110,,1,"And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster."
22111,,1,That Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard.
22112,,1,And you know what?
22113,,1,It is the gold -- she lied.
22114,,1,She lied during the debate.
22115,,1,"She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate?"
22116,,1,Did we win that debate?
22117,,1,But she lied during the debate.
22118,,1,She lied during the debate.
22119,,1,She said it's the gold standard.
22120,,1,And then she said she never said it.Don't worry about coal.
22121,,1,"We're bringing back coal, sir."
22122,,1,He's holding up a couple of  Clean coal.
22123,,1,Clean coal.
22124,,1,Right?
22125,,1,"We're going to do clean coal, the miners."
22126,,1,The miners are going to be back.
22127,,1,Not if Hillary Clinton gets in.
22128,,1,"The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else."
22129,,1,But the miners are going to be back.
22130,,1,Clean coal.
22131,,1,"Clean coalYou know, thinking about it, though."
22132,,1,"Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it."
22133,,1,Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate   but then it turns out to be a number of debates.
22134,,1,Who cares about Donna Brazile?
22135,,1,She's turned out to be not what people thought.
22136,,1,"She gets, illegally -- illegally."
22137,,1,She gets the questions to the debate.
22138,,1,She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton.
22139,,1,"Now, does crooked Hillary report it?"
22140,,1,Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers?
22141,,1,"I think they gave them the answers also, right?"
22142,,1,"No, she doesn't."
22143,,1,They doesn't.
22144,,1,I wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates.
22145,,1,I don't think so because she didn't do that well.
22146,,1,I don't think so.
22147,,1,I don't think so.
22148,,1,But the years of betrayal will end.
22149,,1,And they will end.
22150,,1,And they're going to end quickly.
22151,,1,"They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon."
22152,,1,The theft of North Carolina jobs will end.
22153,,1,You've taken in harder than most states.Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare.
22154,,1,"Sadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes."
22155,,1,Ninety-five   of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year.
22156,,1,"Lots of luck negotiating.Honestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it."
22157,,1,You're going to have such great health care   for much less money.
22158,,1,It won't matter.
22159,,1,Premiums are searching.
22160,,1,Companies are leaving.
22161,,1,Insurers are fleeing.
22162,,1,"Doctors are quitting.By the way, doctors, they're leaving."
22163,,1,They're quitting.
22164,,1,I have a friend who's a doctor.
22165,,1,"He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated."
22166,,1,And deductibles are going through the roof.
22167,,1,Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive.
22168,,1,"I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina."
22169,,1,Thank you.
22170,,1,Thank you.Thank you.
22171,,1,"People are pouring in, folks."
22172,,1,They're pouring in.Did you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had?
22173,,1,"And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag."
22174,,1,You saw that the other night.
22175,,1,And we went to Minnesota.
22176,,1,"Minnesota's been treated very, very badly."
22177,,1,We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well.
22178,,1,Everyone said why Minnesota?
22179,,1,That doesn't go Republican.
22180,,1,"It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you."
22181,,1,Minnesota.
22182,,1,Great place.
22183,,1,"And you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media."
22184,,1,We're winning Ohio.
22185,,1,We're winning Iowa.
22186,,1,"We're winning, we think, New Hampshire."
22187,,1,We're going to do great in New Hampshire.
22188,,1,I hear we're winning North Carolina big   I hear.We're winning Florida.
22189,,1,"We're winning Florida, doing really well."
22190,,1,Headlines today are on drudge.
22191,,1,how well we're doing in Florida.
22192,,1,"And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do."
22193,,1,Then we're winning plenty of other places.
22194,,1,So we have to go.
22195,,1,"The big key, you have to go."
22196,,1,"You don't win a rigged system, folks."
22197,,1,We're in a rigged system.
22198,,1,You got to go.
22199,,1,You got to vote.
22200,,1,Got to make sure that vote gets registered.
22201,,1,Real change also means restoring honesty to our governmentThank you.
22202,,1,Thank you.
22203,,1,Wow.
22204,,1,"Great, great spirit.I have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte."
22205,,1,"You know about it, folks?"
22206,,1,It's great right?
22207,,1,Some of the people.
22208,,1,But it's an amazing place.
22209,,1,"It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it."
22210,,1,Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States.
22211,,1,"She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder."
22212,,1,"And then to cover her tracks   she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her."
22213,,1,Nothing happens  She's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright.
22214,,1,A four-star general.
22215,,1,Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison.
22216,,1,But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that.
22217,,1,Go to jail for up to five years.
22218,,1,"General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt."
22219,,1,It's a rigged system.
22220,,1,It is a rigged rigged system.
22221,,1,"Don't worry, folks."
22222,,1,The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd.
22223,,1,They never do.
22224,,1,"They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me."
22225,,1,They never do.
22226,,1,They never do.
22227,,1,So dishonest.
22228,,1,There they are.
22229,,1,There they are.
22230,,1,My group.
22231,,1,Women for Trump.
22232,,1,Women for Trump.
22233,,1,"They've been following me, these ladies, for a long time."
22234,,1,How are we doing?
22235,,1,Are we doing well?Great people.
22236,,1,Women for Trump.And now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow.
22237,,1,At the ballot box.
22238,,1,We're going to win.I think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country.
22239,,1,I really do.
22240,,1,I think it's a great way.
22241,,1,You show it tomorrow.
22242,,1,We show it tomorrow.
22243,,1,My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests.
22244,,1,"And folks, I was on the other side for a long time."
22245,,1,It's a very good place to be.
22246,,1,But I love the country.
22247,,1,I love this country.
22248,,1,I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere.
22249,,1,We have the greatest people on earth.
22250,,1,But I love this country.
22251,,1,And I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal.
22252,,1,"They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state."
22253,,1,A state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful.
22254,,1,We gave them a path to nuclear weapons.
22255,,1,They were ready to collapse.
22256,,1,"We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right?"
22257,,1,We gave them $400 million.
22258,,1,Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million.
22259,,1,It was $1.7 billion in cash.
22260,,1,In cash.
22261,,1,Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is?
22262,,1,You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room.
22263,,1,How stupid are we to allow this to happen?
22264,,1,Our leaders are incompetent.
22265,,1,President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign.
22266,,1,She can't campaign.
22267,,1,"So Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune."
22268,,1,You know he's very much into the environment.
22269,,1,"And he'll take a massive, old engine 747."
22270,,1,Very much into the environment.
22271,,1,Very much into the ozone layer.
22272,,1,And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.
22273,,1,And I don't think it's going to work.
22274,,1,And she's not getting any crowds.
22275,,1,So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z.
22276,,1,I like them.
22277,,1,I like them.
22278,,1,And you know what they do?
22279,,1,I get bigger crowds than they do.
22280,,1,It's true.
22281,,1,I get far bigger crowds.
22282,,1,Look at this place.
22283,,1,"I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan.By the way, Michigan is in play."
22284,,1,It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years.
22285,,1,Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out.
22286,,1,They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.
22287,,1,Ford.
22288,,1,Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico.
22289,,1,They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico.
22290,,1,And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico.
22291,,1,"No, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day."
22292,,1,I really believe that.
22293,,1,"I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus."
22294,,1,Does that make sense?
22295,,1,"Plus, plus, plus."
22296,,1,It will be amazing.
22297,,1,It will be amazing.I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say.
22298,,1,"This is a phrase, I told you."
22299,,1,I didn't like it.
22300,,1,I thought it was hokie.
22301,,1,But it's not hokie.
22302,,1,"It's called ""drain the swamp."
22303,,1,"We're going to go to Washington.
We're going to drain the swamp.
Can't believe it.I told the story.
I hated that expression.
I said no way I'm going to say that, no way.
That's so hokie.
And I said it.
The place went crazy.Then I said it to another place.
It went crazier.
Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild.
Now I love the expression.
I think it was genius.
Drain the swamp.
Drain the swamp.
Is there any place better to be than a Trump rally?
Are we having fun?
Are we having fun?
No?
And I don't have a guitar.
And I don't have a piano.
All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing.
Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.
And by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night.
And it was -- many of the people left.
You know they're political people.
They heard words they've never heard before.
They left.
So the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them.
Then it was pretty much empty midway through.
And then most of the people just left.
And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people.
It would've been easier.
But you know she hears those words.
I won't use the words.
I won't even address the words.
Because if I do the crooked media will say did you hear what Donald Trump said today?"""
22304,,1,But honestly -- yes.
22305,,1,Those words were disgusting.
22306,,1,"If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me?"
22307,,1,The reinstitution of the electric chair.
22308,,1,It would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate?
22309,,1,Or if I got the questions?
22310,,1,"Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating."
22311,,1,She's a cheat.
22312,,1,She is a cheat.
22313,,1,She never reported it.
22314,,1,She is a cheat.
22315,,1,So supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate.
22316,,1,Headlines all over the world.
22317,,1,He must withdraw from the race.
22318,,1,You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary.
22319,,1,She got the questions.
22320,,1,To me that's such a big difference.
22321,,1,"Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.It's a big deal."
22322,,1,But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say.
22323,,1,They don't want to report it.
22324,,1,"But just think about it, supposing it was us.At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs."
22325,,1,Bring them back to America.
22326,,1,"And by the way, you have a great governor."
22327,,1,Support your governor.
22328,,1,He's a great guy.
22329,,1,Where is he?
22330,,1,He's here someplace.
22331,,1,He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight.
22332,,1,And he's going to win that fight.
22333,,1,But he's a great guy.
22334,,1,So hopefully you'll support your governor.
22335,,1,"North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary."
22336,,1,Well think of it.
22337,,1,Think of it.
22338,,1,Think of the numbers of jobs.Here's the one that gets me the most.
22339,,1,Two things get me the most.
22340,,1,Two things that just don't seem real.
22341,,1,"Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right?"
22342,,1,Like big league.
22343,,1,Because our veterans are great.
22344,,1,But two statistics I can't believe.
22345,,1,Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.Think of it.
22346,,1,You wouldn't think that's possible.
22347,,1,Because they're treated so badly.
22348,,1,"They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription."
22349,,1,But two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense.
22350,,1,Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans.
22351,,1,OK?
22352,,1,It doesn't make sense.And here's another one.
22353,,1,"America has lost 70,000 factories."
22354,,1,"Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe."
22355,,1,"It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster."
22356,,1,Think of it though.
22357,,1,"Think of what 70,000 factories is.So those are the two numbers."
22358,,1,They just don't seem to be real.
22359,,1,Sad numbers.
22360,,1,Sad numbers.
22361,,1,"Especially the vets, to be honest with you.We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world."
22362,,1,There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States.
22363,,1,Our jobs are fleeing.
22364,,1,Our companies are being taken.
22365,,1,And leaving.
22366,,1,And leaving.
22367,,1,A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America.
22368,,1,And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina.
22369,,1,Believe me.
22370,,1,"If a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way."
22371,,1,We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here.
22372,,1,And here's what's going to happen.
22373,,1,They're not going to leave.
22374,,1,"They're not going to leave.Now your politicians, some of them don't understand it."
22375,,1,Some only cut taxes for the middle class.
22376,,1,"And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that  Substantially.So one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes."
22377,,1,"Same old story.We will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal."
22378,,1,"Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that."
22379,,1,We will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations.
22380,,1,Billions and billions of dollars.
22381,,1,And we have no idea what they do with that money.
22382,,1,I actually have a pretty good idea.
22383,,1,You're not going to like it.
22384,,1,And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country.
22385,,1,And we will rebuild our inner cities.
22386,,1,"The African-American community, the Hispanic community   have had such lies told to them."
22387,,1,"They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse."
22388,,1,The crime is unbelievable.
22389,,1,You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread.
22390,,1,Often you get shot.
22391,,1,Chicago.
22392,,1,Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1.
22393,,1,You read it.
22394,,1,The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years.
22395,,1,The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama.
22396,,1,They want you to think Obama is doing a good job.
22397,,1,And he's not.
22398,,1,And he's not.
22399,,1,And he's not.
22400,,1,So you live in the inner cities.
22401,,1,You're African-American.
22402,,1,You're Hispanic.
22403,,1,The schools are no good.
22404,,1,There are no jobs.
22405,,1,And it's totally unsafe.
22406,,1,And I say I will fix it.
22407,,1,What the hell do you have to lose?
22408,,1,I'm going to fix it.
22409,,1,We are all going to fix it.
22410,,1,We're going to fix it.
22411,,1,We're going to bring back jobs.
22412,,1,We're going to bring back safety.
22413,,1,And we're going to get really good education going.
22414,,1,"There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential."
22415,,1,We will become a rich nation again.
22416,,1,"But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation."
22417,,1,Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country.
22418,,1,Unbelievable.
22419,,1,It's unbelievable.
22420,,1,"Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities."
22421,,1,And you don't even know where they're going.
22422,,1,Your government doesn't even know where they're going.
22423,,1,"When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program   and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country."
22424,,1,Have no choice.
22425,,1,We have no choice.
22426,,1,USA.
22427,,1,USA.
22428,,1,USA.
22429,,1,"We have no choice.But we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton.The migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them."
22430,,1,They left a big vacuum.
22431,,1,There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary.
22432,,1,There was no ISIS.
22433,,1,She created it.
22434,,1,"Now she stands at the debate, ""I will fight ISIS."""
22435,,1,She's got no chance.
22436,,1,She's going to fight nobody.
22437,,1,She wants to go home and go to sleep.
22438,,1,Unbelievable.
22439,,1,"She's going to fight ISIS.So we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens."
22440,,1,"We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it."
22441,,1,We have $20 trillion in debt.
22442,,1,"And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny."
22443,,1,We have $20 trillion in debt.
22444,,1,And we still have to rebuild our country.
22445,,1,You know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt.
22446,,1,We have $20 trillion in debt.
22447,,1,But the country's a mess.
22448,,1,The roads are bad.
22449,,1,The bridges are bad.
22450,,1,The schools are bad.
22451,,1,The hospitals are bad.
22452,,1,The tunnels are bad.
22453,,1,Everything's bad.
22454,,1,The military needs massive amounts of money.
22455,,1,So we have all this horrible debt.
22456,,1,It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape.
22457,,1,I like to say.
22458,,1,You know I like the properties.
22459,,1,Give me them.
22460,,1,I want them.
22461,,1,Give me them.
22462,,1,But we have them and they're a mess.
22463,,1,"And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much."
22464,,1,So we're going to get it down.
22465,,1,And we're going to rebuild our country.
22466,,1,We have so many things we're going to be doing.
22467,,1,We're going to be a rich nation again.
22468,,1,A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.
22469,,1,"And yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent."
22470,,1,One hundred percent.
22471,,1,Mexico will pay.
22472,,1,"If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable."
22473,,1,"What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico."
22474,,1,And the numbers with China?
22475,,1,Trade deficit?
22476,,1,I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year.
22477,,1,"We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion."
22478,,1,What are we doing?
22479,,1,"You really ask, who is negotiating these deals?"
22480,,1,Where do these people come?
22481,,1,You know where they come from?
22482,,1,They're political hacks.You're dealing with the smartest people in the world.
22483,,1,"You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries."
22484,,1,They put their smartest and the best.
22485,,1,We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.
22486,,1,So we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world.
22487,,1,We have the greatest business people.
22488,,1,We have the greatest negotiators.
22489,,1,We don't use them.
22490,,1,We don't use them.
22491,,1,We use political people.
22492,,1,Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions.
22493,,1,"We're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow."
22494,,1,Go vote.
22495,,1,Go vote.
22496,,1,Right?My women.
22497,,1,Hillary supports totally open borders.
22498,,1,There goes your country.
22499,,1,And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times.
22500,,1,We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities.
22501,,1,"We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens."
22502,,1,"We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military."
22503,,1,"There have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times."
22504,,1,North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.
22505,,1,Beautiful.
22506,,1,Beautiful.
22507,,1,"Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson.And we're going to have more battalions."
22508,,1,"You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers."
22509,,1,You know that.
22510,,1,I know.
22511,,1,Has there ever been?
22512,,1,"Yes, there have been."
22513,,1,But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now.
22514,,1,The world hates us.
22515,,1,The world hates us.
22516,,1,So we're going to increase -- thank you.
22517,,1,We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune.
22518,,1,I've been to Camp Lejeune  They make major new investments.
22519,,1,"Where I was the other night, right next to it."
22520,,1,"I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg."
22521,,1,Great people.
22522,,1,All soldiers are tough.
22523,,1,A couple of them shook my hand.
22524,,1,"It was like oy, whoa."
22525,,1,"Take it easy, fellas."
22526,,1,They are tough cookies.
22527,,1,They are strong.
22528,,1,They don't know how strong they are.
22529,,1,These are great people.
22530,,1,And new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle.
22531,,1,Right here.
22532,,1,"I'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients."
22533,,1,And every day those numbers go up big league.
22534,,1,Big league.
22535,,1,Show Less TextAnd I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg.
22536,,1,I asked them.
22537,,1,"I said fellas, let me ask you a question."
22538,,1,They want to take over Mosul.
22539,,1,Am I getting something wrong?
22540,,1,Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?
22541,,1,I'm talking to admirals now and generals.
22542,,1,That's what they do.
22543,,1,I do other things.
22544,,1,But you know it's called like common sense.You got to say we've made a lot of right calls.
22545,,1,"I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing ""we are going into Mosul?"""
22546,,1,We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul.
22547,,1,"And then three months they're saying ""we are going in, in three months to Mosul."""
22548,,1,"And then we're going in, in two months."
22549,,1,"And every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this."
22550,,1,"I don't want to hear this, please."
22551,,1,"And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've beenAnd I guarantee you this."
22552,,1,"I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK?"
22553,,1,I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent.
22554,,1,Even our victory isn't 100 percent.
22555,,1,"But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it?"
22556,,1,Those numbers.
22557,,1,Those numbers.
22558,,1,"Oh, these guys are unhappy."
22559,,1,Look at them.
22560,,1,They're not happy.
22561,,1,They are unhappy campers.
22562,,1,Starting to look good.
22563,,1,Starting to look good.But wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago.
22564,,1,Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.
22565,,1,The leaders all left.
22566,,1,They're gone.
22567,,1,And the other people are putting up much more of a fight.
22568,,1,Horrible.
22569,,1,They're using human shields.
22570,,1,It's a horrible situation.
22571,,1,I mean it's hell.
22572,,1,It's hell.But why do we just watch what's going on.
22573,,1,Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win.
22574,,1,We just keep fighting and fighting.
22575,,1,It's like a hose.
22576,,1,The money just keeps pouring out.
22577,,1,We never win.
22578,,1,And now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been.
22579,,1,"We have the Great Migration, the whole thing."
22580,,1,They've dragged -- thank you.
22581,,1,I don't even want to look.
22582,,1,I'll get myself.
22583,,1,I don't want to look.
22584,,1,They'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that.
22585,,1,World's most dishonest people.
22586,,1,The world's really dishonest people.
22587,,1,They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe.
22588,,1,Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home.
22589,,1,"You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of."
22590,,1,And yet we don't protect our own borders.
22591,,1,Isn't it an incredible thing?
22592,,1,That will change starting tomorrow.
22593,,1,"Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first."
22594,,1,"So just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change."
22595,,1,We have to have change.
22596,,1,Can you imagine having Hillary for four years?
22597,,1,I'm being serious about that.
22598,,1,I wouldn't want to watch the news every night.I mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example.
22599,,1,I mean did you ever see a mess like this?
22600,,1,Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure.
22601,,1,"So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days."
22602,,1,Right.
22603,,1,So sad what's going on.
22604,,1,And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress.
22605,,1,I mean that's a crime.
22606,,1,What happened?
22607,,1,That's a crime.
22608,,1,You don't even need the new stuff.
22609,,1,She shouldn't be allowed to run.
22610,,1,Shouldn't be allowed to run.Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration.
22611,,1,We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.And Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially.We're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare.
22612,,1,And Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare.
22613,,1,"That's what's going to happen.We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation."
22614,,1,We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order.
22615,,1,"By the way, a man that loves this state."
22616,,1,It's his birthday today.
22617,,1,"Billy Graham, 98."
22618,,1,The father of Franklin.
22619,,1,Billy Graham.
22620,,1,"What a great one, right?"
22621,,1,Ninety-eight years old.
22622,,1,He is a fantastic man.
22623,,1,Franklin's a fantastic man.
22624,,1,And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.
22625,,1,We're going to protect religious liberty   rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans.
22626,,1,We're going to take care of our veterans.
22627,,1,We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core.
22628,,1,We move our education locally.
22629,,1,"We will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement."
22630,,1,We're going to save our Second Amendment.
22631,,1,And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
22632,,1,"This sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it."
22633,,1,I couldn't stand it.
22634,,1,"Coming down the escalator, right, with Melania."
22635,,1,Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year.
22636,,1,And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits.
22637,,1,Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones.
22638,,1,"But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side."
22639,,1,But I've been involved.
22640,,1,"We had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee."
22641,,1,Where is Mike Huckabee?
22642,,1,He's such -- is he here someplace?
22643,,1,He is here.
22644,,1,He is so great.
22645,,1,"Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great."
22646,,1,I just saw him.But we had 17 people of great talent.
22647,,1,Ben Carson endorsed us.
22648,,1,Mike  Mike endorsed us.
22649,,1,Tremendous -- I mean very talented people.
22650,,1,And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14.
22651,,1,In one state I got 49 percent.
22652,,1,"And one of these clowns said ""he has not reached the 50 percent mark."""
22653,,1,I got 49 percent with like 14 people.
22654,,1,How do you get 49 percent with 14 people?
22655,,1,And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark.
22656,,1,They're very dishonest people.
22657,,1,"So we ended up with 17 people, right?"
22658,,1,"Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent.And we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad."
22659,,1,You know they signed a pledge.
22660,,1,They didn't honor it.
22661,,1,But  But -- no.
22662,,1,But for the most part  No.
22663,,1,For the most part they were very honorable.
22664,,1,But it was rough.
22665,,1,They said it was the roughest primary every.
22666,,1,I would say this is the roughest election.You know the NFL ratings are way down.
22667,,1,You know why?
22668,,1,Because everyone's watching this.
22669,,1,It's actually tougher.
22670,,1,It's actually tougher.
22671,,1,Everyone's watching.
22672,,1,The NFL ratings are way down.
22673,,1,A lot of people say it's because of this.So you had 17 people.
22674,,1,You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room.
22675,,1,We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system.
22676,,1,So well done.
22677,,1,That's a long time.
22678,,1,"You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right."
22679,,1,That's a long time.
22680,,1,I got more than Honest Abe.
22681,,1,That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe.
22682,,1,Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.
22683,,1,So here's the beauty.
22684,,1,You have one day until the election.
22685,,1,And it's not even one day.
22686,,1,It's a half a day.
22687,,1,To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true.
22688,,1,You have one magnificent chance.
22689,,1,"And honestly, in four years it's over, folks."
22690,,1,There has never been a movement like this.
22691,,1,Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly.
22692,,1,He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life.
22693,,1,That's a pretty good statement.
22694,,1,But others have said it.
22695,,1,Others have said it.
22696,,1,Others have said it.
22697,,1,And it's not going to happen again.
22698,,1,It won't be able to happen again.
22699,,1,Four years it'll never happen.
22700,,1,So you got to get out there and you got to vote.
22701,,1,Got to get out.
22702,,1,Somebody said what you've done has never been done before.
22703,,1,It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
22704,,1,"I said believe me, it matters."
22705,,1,"No, they said that."
22706,,1,It'll be down in the history books.
22707,,1,I said you know what?
22708,,1,You may be right about that.
22709,,1,"But if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy."
22710,,1,Wow do I -- you need energy for this.
22711,,1,"The single greatest waste of time, energy and money."
22712,,1,I have over $100 million.
22713,,1,That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it.
22714,,1,That's nice.And we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors?
22715,,1,The small donors are giving us money at record clips.
22716,,1,I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million.
22717,,1,And it comes in.
22718,,1,And I think the average was like $61 each.
22719,,1,I love those people.
22720,,1,Those are people that love this country.
22721,,1,And usually that's for the Democrats.
22722,,1,"You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that."
22723,,1,But we're beating everybody.
22724,,1,Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.
22725,,1,So we don't want to blow it.
22726,,1,We don't want to waste it.
22727,,1,Go vote.
22728,,1,Go vote.
22729,,1,"Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest."
22730,,1,Because nothing's going to happen.
22731,,1,They may say good things about us as a movement.
22732,,1,"Won't mean a damn thing, folks."
22733,,1,You got to go out.
22734,,1,We got to vote and we got to win.
22735,,1,Change.
22736,,1,"Change.So you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation."
22737,,1,Do not let this opportunity slip away.
22738,,1,"We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests."
22739,,1,"And we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans."
22740,,1,We're a very divided country.
22741,,1,People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country.
22742,,1,We're going to come together.
22743,,1,"Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag."
22744,,1,"Just imagine.I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life."
22745,,1,"Because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again."
22746,,1,"God bless you, everybody."
22747,,1,Thank you.
22748,,1,God bless you.
22749,,1,"Thank you, North Carolina."
22750,,1,"Thank you, folks."
22751,,1,Thank you.
